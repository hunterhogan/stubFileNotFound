        Explanation
        ===========

        If the codomain is an FpGroup, the inverse for equal
        elements might not always be the same unless the FpGroup's
        rewriting system is confluent. However, making a system
        confluent can be time-consuming. If it's important, try
        `self.codomain.make_confluent()` first.

def group_isomorphism(G, H, isomorphism: bool = True):
    '''
    Compute an isomorphism between 2 given groups.

    Parameters
    ==========

    G : A finite ``FpGroup`` or a ``PermutationGroup``.
        First group.

    H : A finite ``FpGroup`` or a ``PermutationGroup``
        Second group.

    isomorphism : bool
        This is used to avoid the computation of homomorphism
        when the user only wants to check if there exists
        an isomorphism between the groups.

    Returns
    =======

    If isomorphism = False -- Returns a boolean.
    If isomorphism = True  -- Returns a boolean and an isomorphism between `G` and `H`.

    Notes
    =====

    Uses the approach suggested by Robert Tarjan to compute the isomorphism between two groups.
    First, the generators of ``G`` are mapped to the elements of ``H`` and
    we check if the mapping induces an isomorphism.

def _cmp_perm_lists(first, second):
    """
    Compare two lists of permutations as sets.

    Explanation
    ===========

    This is used for testing purposes. Since the array form of a
    permutation is currently a list, Permutation is not hashable
    and cannot be put into a set.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation
    >>> from sympy.combinatorics.testutil import _cmp_perm_lists
    >>> a = Permutation([0, 2, 3, 4, 1])
    >>> b = Permutation([1, 2, 0, 4, 3])
    >>> c = Permutation([3, 4, 0, 1, 2])
    >>> ls1 = [a, b, c]
    >>> ls2 = [b, c, a]
    >>> _cmp_perm_lists(ls1, ls2)

    Verify the correctness of a base and strong generating set.

    Explanation
    ===========

    This is a naive implementation using the definition of a base and a strong
    generating set relative to it. There are other procedures for
    verifying a base and strong generating set, but this one will
    serve for more robust testing.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> A = AlternatingGroup(4)
    >>> A.schreier_sims()

    Canonicalize tensor formed by tensors of the different types.

    Explanation
    ===========

    sym_i symmetry under exchange of two component tensors of type `i`
          None  no symmetry

          1     anticommuting

    Parameters
    ==========

    g : Permutation representing the tensor.
    dummies : List of dummy indices.
    msym : Symmetry of the metric.
    v : A list of (base_i, gens_i, n_i, sym_i) for tensors of type `i`.

        n_i  number of tensors of type `i`

    Returns
    =======

    Returns 0 if the tensor is zero, else returns the array form of
    the permutation representing the canonical form of the tensor.

def graph_certificate(gr):
    """
    Return a certificate for the graph

    Parameters
    ==========

    gr : adjacency list

    Explanation
    ===========

    The graph is assumed to be unoriented and without
    external lines.

    Associate to each vertex of the graph a symmetric tensor with
    number of indices equal to the degree of the vertex; indices
    are contracted when they correspond to the same line of the graph.
    The canonical form of the tensor gives a certificate for the graph.

    This is not an efficient algorithm to get the certificate of a graph.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.combinatorics.testutil import graph_certificate
    >>> gr1 = {0:[1, 2, 3, 5], 1:[0, 2, 4], 2:[0, 1, 3, 4], 3:[0, 2, 4], 4:[1, 2, 3, 5], 5:[0, 4]}

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import sin, cos, tan, sec
    >>> from sympy.integrals.trigonometry import trigintegrate
    >>> from sympy.abc import x

    >>> trigintegrate(sin(x)*cos(x), x)
    sin(x)**2/2

    >>> trigintegrate(sin(x)**2, x)
    x/2 - sin(x)*cos(x)/2

    >>> trigintegrate(tan(x)*sec(x), x)
    1/cos(x)

    >>> trigintegrate(sin(x)*tan(x), x)
    -log(sin(x) - 1)/2 + log(sin(x) + 1)/2 - sin(x)

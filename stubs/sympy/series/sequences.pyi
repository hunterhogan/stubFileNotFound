class RecursiveSeq(SeqBase):
    '''
    A finite degree recursive sequence.

    Explanation
    ===========

    That is, a sequence a(n) that depends on a fixed, finite number of its
    previous values. The general form is

        a(n) = f(a(n - 1), a(n - 2), ..., a(n - d))

    for some fixed, positive integer d, where f is some function defined by a
    SymPy expression.

    Parameters
    ==========

    recurrence : SymPy expression defining recurrence
        This is *not* an equality, only the expression that the nth term is
        equal to. For example, if :code:`a(n) = f(a(n - 1), ..., a(n - d))`,
        then the expression should be :code:`f(a(n - 1), ..., a(n - d))`.

    yn : applied undefined function
        Represents the nth term of the sequence as e.g. :code:`y(n)` where
        :code:`y` is an undefined function and `n` is the sequence index.

    n : symbolic argument
        The name of the variable that the recurrence is in, e.g., :code:`n` if
        the recurrence function is :code:`y(n)`.

    initial : iterable with length equal to the degree of the recurrence
        The initial values of the recurrence.

    start : start value of sequence (inclusive)

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Function, symbols
    >>> from sympy.series.sequences import RecursiveSeq
    >>> y = Function("y")
    >>> n = symbols("n")
    >>> fib = RecursiveSeq(y(n - 1) + y(n - 2), y(n), n, [0, 1])

    >>> fib.coeff(3) # Value at a particular point

    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]

    >>> fib.recurrence # inspect recurrence
    Eq(y(n), y(n - 2) + y(n - 1))

    >>> fib.degree # automatically determine degree
    2

    >>> for x in zip(range(10), fib): # supports iteration

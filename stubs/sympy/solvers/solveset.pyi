    where $g(x)$ is a simpler function than $f(x)$.  The return value is a tuple
    $(g(x), \\mathrm{set}_h)$, where $g(x)$ is a function of $x$ and $\\mathrm{set}_h$ is
    the set of function $\\left\\{h_1(y), h_2(y), \\dots, h_n(y)\\right\\}$.
    Here, $y$ is not necessarily a symbol.

    $\\mathrm{set}_h$ contains the functions, along with the information
    about the domain in which they are valid, through set
    operations. For instance, if :math:`y = |x| - n` is inverted
    in the real domain, then $\\mathrm{set}_h$ is not simply
    $\\{-n, n\\}$ as the nature of `n` is unknown; rather, it is:

    By default, the complex domain is used which means that inverting even
    seemingly simple functions like $\\exp(x)$ will give very different
    results from those obtained in the real domain.
    (In the case of $\\exp(x)$, the inversion via $\\log$ is multi-valued
    in the complex domain, having infinitely many branches.)

    If you are working with real values only (or you are not sure which
    function to use) you should probably set the domain to
    ``S.Reals`` (or use ``invert_real`` which does that automatically).

    If it is not invertible then (modterm, rhs) is returned.

    The following cases arise while inverting equation ``Mod(a, m) - rhs = 0``:

    1. If a is symbol then  m*n + rhs is the required solution.

    2. If a is an instance of ``Add`` then we try to find two symbol independent
       parts of a and the symbol independent part gets transferred to the other
       side and again the ``_invert_modular`` is called on the symbol
       dependent part.

    3. If a is an instance of ``Mul`` then same as we done in ``Add`` we separate
       out the symbol dependent and symbol independent parts and transfer the
       symbol independent part to the rhs with the help of invert and again the
       ``_invert_modular`` is called on the symbol dependent part.

    4. If a is an instance of ``Pow`` then two cases arise as following:

        - If a is of type (symbol_indep)**(symbol_dep) then the remainder is
          evaluated with the help of discrete_log function and then the least

    * Proof of correctness of the method

    The logarithm function is the inverse of the exponential function.
    The defining relation between exponentiation and logarithm is:

    .. math:: {\\log_b x} = y \\enspace if \\enspace b^y = x

    Therefore if we are given an equation with exponent terms, we can
    convert every term to its corresponding logarithmic form. This is
    achieved by taking logarithms and expanding the equation using
    logarithmic identities so that it can easily be handled by ``solveset``.

    For example:

    .. math:: 3^{2x} = 2^{x + 3}

    Taking log both sides will reduce the equation to

    .. math:: (2x)\\log(3) = (x + 3)\\log(2)

    This form can be easily handed by ``solveset``.

def _solve_logarithm(lhs, rhs, symbol, domain):
    """
    Helper to solve logarithmic equations which are reducible
    to a single instance of `\\log`.

    Logarithmic equations are (currently) the equations that contains
    `\\log` terms which can be reduced to a single `\\log` term or
    a constant using various logarithmic identities.

    For example:

    .. math:: \\log(x) + \\log(x - 4)

    can be reduced to:

    .. math:: \\log(x(x - 4))

    Parameters
    ==========

    lhs, rhs : Expr
        The logarithmic equation to be solved, `lhs = rhs`

    symbol : Symbol
        The variable in which the equation is solved

    domain : Set
        A set over which the equation is solved.

    Returns
    =======

    A set of solutions satisfying the given equation.
    A ``ConditionSet`` if the equation is unsolvable.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import symbols, log, S
    >>> from sympy.solvers.solveset import _solve_logarithm as solve_log
    >>> x = symbols('x')
    >>> f = log(x - 3) + log(x + 3)
    >>> solve_log(f, 0, x, S.Reals)
    {-sqrt(10), sqrt(10)}

    * Proof of correctness

    A logarithm is another way to write exponent and is defined by

    .. math:: {\\log_b x} = y \\enspace if \\enspace b^y = x

    When one side of the equation contains a single logarithm, the
    equation can be solved by rewriting the equation as an equivalent
    exponential equation as defined above. But if one side contains
    more than one logarithm, we need to use the properties of logarithm
    to condense it into a single logarithm.

    Take for example

    .. math:: \\log(2x) - 15 = 0

    contains single logarithm, therefore we can directly rewrite it to
    exponential form as

    .. math:: x = \\frac{e^{15}}{2}

    But if the equation has more than one logarithm as

    .. math:: \\log(x - 3) + \\log(x + 3) = 0

    we use logarithmic identities to convert it into a reduced form

    Using,

    .. math:: \\log(a) + \\log(b) = \\log(ab)

    the equation becomes,

    .. math:: \\log((x - 3)(x + 3))

    This equation contains one logarithm and can be solved by rewriting
    to exponents.

def _is_lambert(f, symbol):

    If this returns ``False`` then the Lambert solver (``_solve_lambert``) will not be called.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Quick check for cases that the Lambert solver might be able to handle.

    1. Equations containing more than two operands and `symbol`s involving any of
       `Pow`, `exp`, `HyperbolicFunction`,`TrigonometricFunction`, `log` terms.

    2. In `Pow`, `exp` the exponent should have `symbol` whereas for
       `HyperbolicFunction`,`TrigonometricFunction`, `log` should contain `symbol`.

    3. For `HyperbolicFunction`,`TrigonometricFunction` the number of trigonometric functions in
       equation should be less than number of symbols. (since `A*cos(x) + B*sin(x) - c`
       is not the Lambert type).

    Some forms of lambert equations are:
        1. X**X = C
        2. X*(B*log(X) + D)**A = C
        3. A*log(B*X + A) + d*X = C
        4. (B*X + A)*exp(d*X + g) = C
        5. g*exp(B*X + h) - B*X = C
        6. A*D**(E*X + g) - B*X = C
        7. A*cos(X) + B*sin(X) - D*X = C
        8. A*cosh(X) + B*sinh(X) - D*X = C

    Where X is any variable,
          A, B, C, D, E are any constants,
          g, h are linear functions or log terms.

    Parameters
    ==========

    f : Expr
        The equation to be checked

    symbol : Symbol

    """
def _transolve(f, symbol, domain):
    """
    Function to solve transcendental equations. It is a helper to
    ``solveset`` and should be used internally. ``_transolve``
    currently supports the following class of equations:

        - Exponential equations
        - Logarithmic equations

    Parameters
    ==========

    f : Any transcendental equation that needs to be solved.
        This needs to be an expression, which is assumed
        to be equal to ``0``.

    symbol : The variable for which the equation is solved.
        This needs to be of class ``Symbol``.

    domain : A set over which the equation is solved.
        This needs to be of class ``Set``.

    Returns
    =======

    Set
        A set of values for ``symbol`` for which ``f`` is equal to
        zero. An ``EmptySet`` is returned if ``f`` does not have solutions
        in respective domain. A ``ConditionSet`` is returned as unsolved
        object if algorithms to evaluate complete solution are not
        yet implemented.

    How to use ``_transolve``
    =========================

    ``_transolve`` should not be used as an independent function, because
    it assumes that the equation (``f``) and the ``symbol`` comes from
    ``solveset`` and might have undergone a few modification(s).
    To use ``_transolve`` as an independent function the equation (``f``)
    and the ``symbol`` should be passed as they would have been by
    ``solveset``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.solvers.solveset import _transolve as transolve
    >>> from sympy.solvers.solvers import _tsolve as tsolve
    >>> from sympy import symbols, S, pprint
    >>> x = symbols('x', real=True) # assumption added
    >>> transolve(5**(x - 3) - 3**(2*x + 1), x, S.Reals)
    {-(log(3) + 3*log(5))/(-log(5) + 2*log(3))}

    How ``_transolve`` works
    ========================

    ``_transolve`` uses two types of helper functions to solve equations
    of a particular class:

    Identifying helpers: To determine whether a given equation
    belongs to a certain class of equation or not. Returns either
    ``True`` or ``False``.

    Solving helpers: Once an equation is identified, a corresponding
    helper either solves the equation or returns a form of the equation
    that ``solveset`` might better be able to handle.

    * Philosophy behind the module

    The purpose of ``_transolve`` is to take equations which are not
    already polynomial in their generator(s) and to either recast them
    as such through a valid transformation or to solve them outright.
    A pair of helper functions for each class of supported
    transcendental functions are employed for this purpose. One
    identifies the transcendental form of an equation and the other
    either solves it or recasts it into a tractable form that can be
    solved by  ``solveset``.
    For example, an equation in the form `ab^{f(x)} - cd^{g(x)} = 0`
    can be transformed to
    `\\log(a) + f(x)\\log(b) - \\log(c) - g(x)\\log(d) = 0`
    (under certain assumptions) and this can be solved with ``solveset``
    if `f(x)` and `g(x)` are in polynomial form.

    How ``_transolve`` is better than ``_tsolve``
    =============================================

    1) Better output

    ``_transolve`` provides expressions in a more simplified form.

    Consider a simple exponential equation

    >>> f = 3**(2*x) - 2**(x + 3)
    >>> pprint(transolve(f, x, S.Reals), use_unicode=False)
        -3*log(2)
    {------------------}
     -2*log(3) + log(2)
    >>> pprint(tsolve(f, x), use_unicode=False)
         /   3     \\\n         | --------|
         | log(2/9)|
    [-log\\2         /]

    2) Extensible

    The API of ``_transolve`` is designed such that it is easily
    extensible, i.e. the code that solves a given class of
    equations is encapsulated in a helper and not mixed in with
    the code of ``_transolve`` itself.

    3) Modular

    ``_transolve`` is designed to be modular i.e, for every class of
    equation a separate helper for identification and solving is
    implemented. This makes it easy to change or modify any of the
    method implemented directly in the helpers without interfering
    with the actual structure of the API.

    4) Faster Computation

    Solving equation via ``_transolve`` is much faster as compared to
    ``_tsolve``. In ``solve``, attempts are made computing every possibility
    to get the solutions. This series of attempts makes solving a bit
    slow. In ``_transolve``, computation begins only after a particular
    type of equation is identified.

    How to add new class of equations
    =================================

    Adding a new class of equation solver is a three-step procedure:

    - Identify the type of the equations

      Determine the type of the class of equations to which they belong:
      it could be of ``Add``, ``Pow``, etc. types. Separate internal functions
      are used for each type. Write identification and solving helpers
      and use them from within the routine for the given type of equation
      (after adding it, if necessary). Something like:

      .. code-block:: python

        def add_type(lhs, rhs, x):
            ....
            if _is_exponential(lhs, x):
                new_eq = _solve_exponential(lhs, rhs, x)
        ....
        rhs, lhs = eq.as_independent(x)
        if lhs.is_Add:
            result = add_type(lhs, rhs, x)

    - Define the identification helper.

    - Define the solving helper.

    Apart from this, a few other things needs to be taken care while
    adding an equation solver:

    - Naming conventions:
      Name of the identification helper should be as
      ``_is_class`` where class will be the name or abbreviation
      of the class of equation. The solving helper will be named as
      ``_solve_class``.
      For example: for exponential equations it becomes
      ``_is_exponential`` and ``_solve_expo``.
    - The identifying helpers should take two input parameters,
      the equation to be checked and the variable for which a solution
      is being sought, while solving helpers would require an additional
      domain parameter.
    - Be sure to consider corner cases.
    - Add tests for each helper.
    - Add a docstring to your helper that describes the method
      implemented.
      The documentation of the helpers should identify:

      - the purpose of the helper,
      - the method used to identify and solve the equation,
      - a proof of correctness
      - the return values of the helpers

        b = Matrix([[1], [-2], [0]])
        system = (A, b)

    Symbols can always be passed but are actually only needed
    when 1) a system of equations is being passed and 2) the
    system is passed as an underdetermined matrix and one wants
    to control the name of the free variables in the result.
    An error is raised if no symbols are used for case 1, but if
    no symbols are provided for case 2, internally generated symbols
    will be provided. When providing symbols for case 2, there should
    be at least as many symbols are there are columns in matrix A.

    The algorithm used here is Gauss-Jordan elimination, which
    results, after elimination, in a row echelon form matrix.

    Returns
    =======

    A FiniteSet containing an ordered tuple of values for the
    unknowns for which the `system` has a solution. (Wrapping
    the tuple in FiniteSet is used to maintain a consistent
    output format throughout solveset.)

    Returns EmptySet, if the linear system is inconsistent.

    Raises
    ======

    ValueError
        The input is not valid.
        The symbols are not given.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Matrix, linsolve, symbols
    >>> x, y, z = symbols("x, y, z")
    >>> A = Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 10]])

    [3],
    [6],
    [9]])
    >>> linsolve((A, b), [x, y, z])
    {(-1, 2, 0)}

    * Parametric Solution: In case the system is underdetermined, the
      function will return a parametric solution in terms of the given
      symbols. Those that are free will be returned unchanged. e.g. in
      the system below, `z` is returned as the solution for variable z;
      it can take on any value.

    >>> A = Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    >>> b = Matrix([3, 6, 9])
    >>> linsolve((A, b), x, y, z)
    {(z - 1, 2 - 2*z, z)}

    If no symbols are given, internally generated symbols will be used.
    The ``tau0`` in the third position indicates (as before) that the third
    variable -- whatever it is named -- can take on any value:

    >>> linsolve((A, b))
    {(tau0 - 1, 2 - 2*tau0, tau0)}

    >>> aug
    Matrix([
    [2, 1,  3, 1],
    [2, 6,  8, 3],
    [6, 8, 18, 5]])
    >>> linsolve(aug, x, y, z)
    {(3/10, 2/5, 0)}

    * Solve for symbolic coefficients

    >>> a, b, c, d, e, f = symbols(\'a, b, c, d, e, f\')
    >>> eqns = [a*x + b*y - c, d*x + e*y - f]
    >>> linsolve(eqns, x, y)
    {((-b*f + c*e)/(a*e - b*d), (a*f - c*d)/(a*e - b*d))}

    * A degenerate system returns solution as set of given
      symbols.

    >>> system = Matrix(([0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]))
    >>> linsolve(system, x, y)
    {(x, y)}

    * For an empty system linsolve returns empty set

    >>> linsolve([], x)
    EmptySet

    * An error is raised if any nonlinearity is detected, even
      if it could be removed with expansion

    Returns
    =======

    A FiniteSet of ordered tuple of values of `all_symbols` for which the

    here is not simply a FiniteSet of solutions, rather it is a FiniteSet of
    ordered tuple, i.e. the first & only argument to FiniteSet is a tuple of
    solutions, which is ordered, & hence the returned solution is ordered.

    Also note that solution could also have been returned as an ordered tuple,
    FiniteSet is just a wrapper `{}` around the tuple. It has no other

    ======

    ValueError
        The input is not valid.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import symbols, nonlinsolve
    >>> x, y, z = symbols('x, y, z', real=True)
    >>> nonlinsolve([x*y - 1, 4*x**2 + y**2 - 5], [x, y])
    {(-1, -1), (-1/2, -2), (1/2, 2), (1, 1)}

    1. Positive dimensional system and complements:

    >>> from sympy import pprint
    >>> from sympy.polys.polytools import is_zero_dimensional
    >>> a, b, c, d = symbols('a, b, c, d', extended_real=True)
    >>> eq1 =  a + b + c + d
    >>> eq2 = a*b + b*c + c*d + d*a
    >>> eq3 = a*b*c + b*c*d + c*d*a + d*a*b
    >>> eq4 = a*b*c*d - 1
    >>> system = [eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4]
    >>> is_zero_dimensional(system)
    False
    >>> pprint(nonlinsolve(system, [a, b, c, d]), use_unicode=False)
      -1       1               1      -1
    {(---, -d, -, {d} \\ {0}), (-, -d, ---, {d} \\ {0})}
       d       d               d       d
    >>> nonlinsolve([(x+y)**2 - 4, x + y - 2], [x, y])
    {(2 - y, y)}

    2. If some of the equations are non-polynomial then `nonlinsolve`
    will call the ``substitution`` function and return real and complex solutions,
    if present.

    >>> from sympy import exp, sin
    >>> nonlinsolve([exp(x) - sin(y), y**2 - 4], [x, y])
    {(ImageSet(Lambda(_n, I*(2*_n*pi + pi) + log(sin(2))), Integers), -2),
     (ImageSet(Lambda(_n, 2*_n*I*pi + log(sin(2))), Integers), 2)}

    3. If system is non-linear polynomial and zero-dimensional then it
    returns both solution (real and complex solutions, if present) using
    :func:`~.solve_poly_system`:

    >>> from sympy import sqrt
    >>> nonlinsolve([x**2 - 2*y**2 -2, x*y - 2], [x, y])
    {(-2, -1), (2, 1), (-sqrt(2)*I, sqrt(2)*I), (sqrt(2)*I, -sqrt(2)*I)}

    4. ``nonlinsolve`` can solve some linear (zero or positive dimensional)
    system (because it uses the :func:`sympy.polys.polytools.groebner` function to get the
    groebner basis and then uses the ``substitution`` function basis as the
    new `system`). But it is not recommended to solve linear system using
    ``nonlinsolve``, because :func:`~.linsolve` is better for general linear systems.

    >>> nonlinsolve([x + 2*y -z - 3, x - y - 4*z + 9, y + z - 4], [x, y, z])
    {(3*z - 5, 4 - z, z)}

    5. System having polynomial equations and only real solution is
    solved using :func:`~.solve_poly_system`:

    >>> e1 = sqrt(x**2 + y**2) - 10
    >>> e2 = sqrt(y**2 + (-x + 10)**2) - 3
    >>> nonlinsolve((e1, e2), (x, y))
    {(191/20, -3*sqrt(391)/20), (191/20, 3*sqrt(391)/20)}
    >>> nonlinsolve([x**2 + 2/y - 2, x + y - 3], [x, y])
    {(1, 2), (1 - sqrt(5), 2 + sqrt(5)), (1 + sqrt(5), 2 - sqrt(5))}
    >>> nonlinsolve([x**2 + 2/y - 2, x + y - 3], [y, x])
    {(2, 1), (2 - sqrt(5), 1 + sqrt(5)), (2 + sqrt(5), 1 - sqrt(5))}

    6. It is better to use symbols instead of trigonometric functions or
    :class:`~.Function`. For example, replace $\\sin(x)$ with a symbol, replace
    $f(x)$ with a symbol and so on. Get a solution from ``nonlinsolve`` and then
    use :func:`~.solveset` to get the value of $x$.

    How nonlinsolve is better than old solver ``_solve_system`` :
    =============================================================

    1. A positive dimensional system solver: nonlinsolve can return
    solution for positive dimensional system. It finds the
    Groebner Basis of the positive dimensional system(calling it as
    basis) then we can start solving equation(having least number of
    variable first in the basis) using solveset and substituting that
    solved solutions into other equation(of basis) to get solution in
    terms of minimum variables. Here the important thing is how we
    are substituting the known values and in which equations.

    2. Real and complex solutions: nonlinsolve returns both real
    and complex solution. If all the equations in the system are polynomial
    then using :func:`~.solve_poly_system` both real and complex solution is returned.
    If all the equations in the system are not polynomial equation then goes to
    ``substitution`` method with this polynomial and non polynomial equation(s),
    to solve for unsolved variables. Here to solve for particular variable
    solveset_real and solveset_complex is used. For both real and complex
    solution ``_solve_using_known_values`` is used inside ``substitution``
    (``substitution`` will be called when any non-polynomial equation is present).
    If a solution is valid its general solution is added to the final result.

    3. :class:`~.Complement` and :class:`~.Intersection` will be added:
    nonlinsolve maintains dict for complements and intersections. If solveset
    find complements or/and intersections with any interval or set during the
    execution of ``substitution`` function, then complement or/and
    intersection for that variable is added before returning final solution.

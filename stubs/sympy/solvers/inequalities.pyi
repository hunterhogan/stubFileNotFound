    If the relationship is non-linear, a solution involving And or Or
    may be returned. False or True are returned if the relationship
    is never True or always True, respectively.

    If `linear` is True (default is False) an `s`-dependent expression
    will be isolated on the left, if possible
    but it will not be solved for `s` unless the expression is linear
    in `s`. Furthermore, only "safe" operations which do not change the
    sense of the relationship are applied: no division by an unsigned
    value is attempted unless the relationship involves Eq or Ne and
    no division by a value not known to be nonzero is ever attempted.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Eq, Symbol
    >>> from sympy.solvers.inequalities import _solve_inequality as f
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y

    For linear expressions, the symbol can be isolated:

    >>> f(x - 2 < 0, x)
    x < 2
    >>> f(-x - 6 < x, x)
    x > -3

    Sometimes nonlinear relationships will be False

    >>> f(x**2 + 4 < 0, x)
    False

    Or they may involve more than one region of values:

    >>> f(x**2 - 4 < 0, x)
    (-2 < x) & (x < 2)

    To restrict the solution to a relational, set linear=True
    and only the x-dependent portion will be isolated on the left:

    >>> f(x**2 - 4 < 0, x, linear=True)
    x**2 < 4

    Division of only nonzero quantities is allowed, so x cannot
    be isolated by dividing by y:

    >>> y.is_nonzero is None  # it is unknown whether it is 0 or not
    True
    >>> f(x*y < 1, x)
    x*y < 1

    And while an equality (or inequality) still holds after dividing by a
    non-zero quantity

    >>> nz = Symbol(\'nz\', nonzero=True)
    >>> f(Eq(x*nz, 1), x)
    Eq(x, 1/nz)

    the sign must be known for other inequalities involving > or <:

    >>> f(x*nz <= 1, x)
    nz*x <= 1
    >>> p = Symbol(\'p\', positive=True)
    >>> f(x*p <= 1, x)
    x <= 1/p

    When there are denominators in the original expression that
    are removed by expansion, conditions for them will be returned
    as part of the result:

    (x < 1) & Ne(x, 0)

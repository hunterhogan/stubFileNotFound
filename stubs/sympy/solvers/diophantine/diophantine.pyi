def diophantine(eq, param=..., syms=None, permute: bool = False):
    """
    Simplify the solution procedure of diophantine equation ``eq`` by
    converting it into a product of terms which should equal zero.

    Explanation
    ===========

    For example, when solving, `x^2 - y^2 = 0` this is treated as
    `(x + y)(x - y) = 0` and `x + y = 0` and `x - y = 0` are solved
    independently and combined. Each term is solved by calling
    ``diop_solve()``. (Although it is possible to call ``diop_solve()``
    directly, one must be careful to pass an equation in the correct
    form and to interpret the output correctly; ``diophantine()`` is
    the public-facing function to use in general.)

    Output of ``diophantine()`` is a set of tuples. The elements of the
    tuple are the solutions for each variable in the equation and
    are arranged according to the alphabetic ordering of the variables.
    e.g. For an equation with two variables, `a` and `b`, the first
    element of the tuple is the solution for `a` and the second for `b`.

    Usage
    =====

    ``diophantine(eq, t, syms)``: Solve the diophantine
    equation ``eq``.
    ``t`` is the optional parameter to be used by ``diop_solve()``.
    ``syms`` is an optional list of symbols which determines the
    order of the elements in the returned tuple.

    By default, only the base solution is returned. If ``permute`` is set to
    True then permutations of the base solution and/or permutations of the
    signs of the values will be returned when applicable.

    Details
    =======

    ``eq`` should be an expression which is assumed to be zero.
    ``t`` is the parameter to be used in the solution.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import diophantine
    >>> from sympy.abc import a, b
    >>> eq = a**4 + b**4 - (2**4 + 3**4)
    >>> diophantine(eq)
    {(2, 3)}
    >>> diophantine(eq, permute=True)
    {(-3, -2), (-3, 2), (-2, -3), (-2, 3), (2, -3), (2, 3), (3, -2), (3, 2)}

    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
    >>> diophantine(x**2 - y**2)
    {(t_0, -t_0), (t_0, t_0)}

    >>> diophantine(x*(2*x + 3*y - z))
    {(0, n1, n2), (t_0, t_1, 2*t_0 + 3*t_1)}
    >>> diophantine(x**2 + 3*x*y + 4*x)
    {(0, n1), (-3*t_0 - 4, t_0)}

    Explanation
    ===========

    Serves as superclass for Normal/Exponential/UniformDistribution etc....

    Represented by parameters for each of the specific classes.  E.g
    NormalDistribution is represented by a mean and standard deviation.

    Provides methods for pdf, cdf, and sampling.

    Represents probability space of stochastic processes

    Explanation
    ===========

    Initialized by symbol, the specific process and
    distribution(optional) if the random indexed symbols
    of the process follows any specific distribution, like,
    in Bernoulli Process, each random indexed symbol follows
    Bernoulli distribution. For processes with memory, this
    parameter should not be passed.

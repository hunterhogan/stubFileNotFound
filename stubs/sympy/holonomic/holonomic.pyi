    This function is used to create annihilators using ``Dx``.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Returns an Algebra of Differential Operators also called Weyl Algebra
    and the operator for differentiation i.e. the ``Dx`` operator.

    Parameters
    ==========

    base:
        Base polynomial ring for the algebra.
        The base polynomial ring is the ring of polynomials in :math:`x` that
        will appear as coefficients in the operators.
    generator:
        Generator of the algebra which can
        be either a noncommutative ``Symbol`` or a string. e.g. "Dx" or "D".

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import ZZ

    '''

class DifferentialOperatorAlgebra:
    """
    An Ore Algebra is a set of noncommutative polynomials in the
    intermediate ``Dx`` and coefficients in a base polynomial ring :math:`A`.
    It follows the commutation rule:

    .. math ::
       Dxa = \\sigma(a)Dx + \\delta(a)

    for :math:`a \\subset A`.

    Where :math:`\\sigma: A \\Rightarrow A` is an endomorphism and :math:`\\delta: A \\rightarrow A`
    is a skew-derivation i.e. :math:`\\delta(ab) = \\delta(a) b + \\sigma(a) \\delta(b)`.

    If one takes the sigma as identity map and delta as the standard derivation
    then it becomes the algebra of Differential Operators also called
    a Weyl Algebra i.e. an algebra whose elements are Differential Operators.

    This class represents a Weyl Algebra and serves as the parent ring for
    Differential Operators.

    A Holonomic Function is a solution to a linear homogeneous ordinary

    equation can also be represented by an annihilator i.e. a Differential
    Operator ``L`` such that :math:`L.f = 0`. For uniqueness of these functions,
    initial conditions can also be provided along with the annihilator.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Holonomic functions have closure properties and thus forms a ring.
    Given two Holonomic Functions f and g, their sum, product,
    integral and derivative is also a Holonomic Function.

    For ordinary points initial condition should be a vector of values of
    the derivatives i.e. :math:`[y(x_0), y\'(x_0), y\'\'(x_0) ... ]`.

    For regular singular points initial conditions can also be provided in this
    format:
    :math:`{s0: [C_0, C_1, ...], s1: [C^1_0, C^1_1, ...], ...}`
    where s0, s1, ... are the roots of indicial equation and vectors
    :math:`[C_0, C_1, ...], [C^0_0, C^0_1, ...], ...` are the corresponding initial
    terms of the associated power series. See Examples below.

def cse(exprs, symbols=None, optimizations=None, postprocess=None, order: str = 'canonical', ignore=(), list: bool = True):
    ''' Perform common subexpression elimination on an expression.

    Parameters
    ==========

    exprs : list of SymPy expressions, or a single SymPy expression
        The expressions to reduce.
    symbols : infinite iterator yielding unique Symbols
        The symbols used to label the common subexpressions which are pulled
        out. The ``numbered_symbols`` generator is useful. The default is a
        stream of symbols of the form "x0", "x1", etc. This must be an
        infinite iterator.
    optimizations : list of (callable, callable) pairs
        The (preprocessor, postprocessor) pairs of external optimization
        functions. Optionally \'basic\' can be passed for a set of predefined
        basic optimizations. Such \'basic\' optimizations were used by default
        in old implementation, however they can be really slow on larger
        expressions. Now, no pre or post optimizations are made by default.
    postprocess : a function which accepts the two return values of cse and
        returns the desired form of output from cse, e.g. if you want the
        replacements reversed the function might be the following lambda:
        lambda r, e: return reversed(r), e
    order : string, \'none\' or \'canonical\'
        The order by which Mul and Add arguments are processed. If set to
        \'canonical\', arguments will be canonically ordered. If set to \'none\',
        ordering will be faster but dependent on expressions hashes, thus
        machine dependent and variable. For large expressions where speed is a
        concern, use the setting order=\'none\'.
    ignore : iterable of Symbols
        Substitutions containing any Symbol from ``ignore`` will be ignored.
    list : bool, (default True)
        Returns expression in list or else with same type as input (when False).

    Returns
    =======

    replacements : list of (Symbol, expression) pairs
        All of the common subexpressions that were replaced. Subexpressions
        earlier in this list might show up in subexpressions later in this
        list.
    reduced_exprs : list of SymPy expressions
        The reduced expressions with all of the replacements above.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import cse, SparseMatrix
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, w
    >>> cse(((w + x + y + z)*(w + y + z))/(w + x)**3)
    ([(x0, y + z), (x1, w + x)], [(w + x0)*(x0 + x1)/x1**3])


    List of expressions with recursive substitutions:

    >>> m = SparseMatrix([x + y, x + y + z])
    >>> cse([(x+y)**2, x + y + z, y + z, x + z + y, m])
    ([(x0, x + y), (x1, x0 + z)], [x0**2, x1, y + z, x1, Matrix([
    [x0],
    [x1]])])

    Note: the type and mutability of input matrices is retained.

    >>> isinstance(_[1][-1], SparseMatrix)
    True

    The user may disallow substitutions containing certain symbols:

    >>> cse([y**2*(x + 1), 3*y**2*(x + 1)], ignore=(y,))
    ([(x0, x + 1)], [x0*y**2, 3*x0*y**2])

    The default return value for the reduced expression(s) is a list, even if there is only
    one expression. The `list` flag preserves the type of the input in the output:

    >>> cse(x)
    ([], [x])
    >>> cse(x, list=False)
    ([], x)

    Explanation
    ===========

    The instance can be used as a function on expressions for which

    Parameters
    ==========

    query :
        First argument passed to replace.
    value :
        Second argument passed to replace.

class FuncMinusOneOptim(ReplaceOptim):
    '''Specialization of ReplaceOptim for functions evaluating "f(x) - 1".

    Explanation
    ===========

    Numerical functions which go toward one as x go toward zero is often best
    implemented by a dedicated function in order to avoid catastrophic
    cancellation. One such example is ``expm1(x)`` in the C standard library
    which evaluates ``exp(x) - 1``. Such functions preserves many more
    significant digits when its argument is much smaller than one, compared
    to subtracting one afterwards.

    Parameters
    ==========

    func :
        The function which is subtracted by one.
    func_m_1 :
        The specialized function evaluating ``func(x) - 1``.
    opportunistic : bool
        When ``True``, apply the transformation as long as the magnitude of the
        remaining number terms decreases. When ``False``, only apply the
        transformation if it completely eliminates the number term.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import symbols, exp
    >>> from sympy.codegen.rewriting import FuncMinusOneOptim
    >>> from sympy.codegen.cfunctions import expm1
    >>> x, y = symbols(\'x y\')
    >>> expm1_opt = FuncMinusOneOptim(exp, expm1)
    >>> expm1_opt(exp(x) + 2*exp(5*y) - 3)

def create_expand_pow_optimization(limit, *, base_req=...):
    """ Creates an instance of :class:`ReplaceOptim` for expanding ``Pow``.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The requirements for expansions are that the base needs to be a symbol
    and the exponent needs to be an Integer (and be less than or equal to
    ``limit``).

    Parameters
    ==========

    limit : int
         The highest power which is expanded into multiplication.
    base_req : function returning bool
         Requirement on base for expansion to happen, default is to return
         the ``is_symbol`` attribute of the base.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Symbol, sin
    >>> from sympy.codegen.rewriting import create_expand_pow_optimization
    >>> x = Symbol('x')
    >>> expand_opt = create_expand_pow_optimization(3)

def generate_known_facts_dict(keys, fact):
    """
    Computes and returns a dictionary which contains the relations between
    unary predicates.

    Each key is a predicate, and item is two groups of predicates.
    First group contains the predicates which are implied by the key, and
    second group contains the predicates which are rejected by the key.

    All predicates in *keys* and *fact* must be unary and have same placeholder
    symbol.

    Parameters
    ==========

    keys : list of AppliedPredicate instances.

    fact : Fact between predicates in conjugated normal form.

    Examples

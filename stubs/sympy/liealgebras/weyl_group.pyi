    For each semisimple Lie group, we have a Weyl group.  It is a subgroup of
    the isometry group of the root system.  Specifically, it's the subgroup

        The vertices of the Coxeter diagram represent the generating reflections

        $m(i, j)$ of $s_is_j$ is greater than two.  If there is one edge, the order
        $m(i, j)$ is 3.  If there are two edges, the order $m(i, j)$ is 4, and if there
        are three edges, the order $m(i, j)$ is 6.

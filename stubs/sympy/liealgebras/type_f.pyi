        Every lie algebra has a unique root system.
        Given a root system Q, there is a subset of the
        roots such that an element of Q is called a
        simple root if it cannot be written as the sum
        of two elements in Q.  If we let D denote the
        set of simple roots, then it is clear that every
        element of Q can be written as a linear combination
        of elements of D with all coefficients non-negative.

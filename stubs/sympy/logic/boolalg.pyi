    '''
    SymPy version of ``True``, a singleton that can be accessed via ``S.true``.

    This is the SymPy version of ``True``, for use in the logic module. The
    primary advantage of using ``true`` instead of ``True`` is that shorthand Boolean
    operations like ``~`` and ``>>`` will work as expected on this class, whereas with
    True they act bitwise on 1. Functions in the logic module will return this
    class when they evaluate to true.

    Notes
    =====

    There is liable to be some confusion as to when ``True`` should
    be used and when ``S.true`` should be used in various contexts
    throughout SymPy. An important thing to remember is that
    ``sympify(True)`` returns ``S.true``. This means that for the most
    part, you can just use ``True`` and it will automatically be converted
    to ``S.true`` when necessary, similar to how you can generally use 1
    instead of ``S.One``.

    The rule of thumb is:

    "If the boolean in question can be replaced by an arbitrary symbolic
    ``Boolean``, like ``Or(x, y)`` or ``x > 1``, use ``S.true``.
    Otherwise, use ``True``"

    In other words, use ``S.true`` only on those contexts where the
    boolean is being used as a symbolic representation of truth.
    For example, if the object ends up in the ``.args`` of any expression,
    then it must necessarily be ``S.true`` instead of ``True``, as
    elements of ``.args`` must be ``Basic``. On the other hand,
    ``==`` is not a symbolic operation in SymPy, since it always returns
    ``True`` or ``False``, and does so in terms of structural equality
    rather than mathematical, so it should return ``True``. The assumptions
    system should use ``True`` and ``False``. Aside from not satisfying
    the above rule of thumb, the assumptions system uses a three-valued logic
    (``True``, ``False``, ``None``), whereas ``S.true`` and ``S.false``
    represent a two-valued logic. When in doubt, use ``True``.

    "``S.true == True is True``."

    While "``S.true is True``" is ``False``, "``S.true == True``"
    is ``True``, so if there is any doubt over whether a function or
    expression will return ``S.true`` or ``True``, just use ``==``
    instead of ``is`` to do the comparison, and it will work in either
    case.  Finally, for boolean flags, it\'s better to just use ``if x``
    instead of ``if x is True``. To quote PEP 8:

    Do not compare boolean values to ``True`` or ``False``
    using ``==``.

    * Yes:   ``if greeting:``
    * No:    ``if greeting == True:``
    * Worse: ``if greeting is True:``

    up to `2^4 = 16` monomials. The 13-th monomial is the
    product ``a & b & d``, because 13 in binary is 1, 1, 0, 1.

    Return the k-th monomial.

    Monomials are numbered by a binary encoding of the presence and
    absences of the variables. This convention assigns the value
    1 to the presence of variable and 0 to the absence of variable.

    Each boolean function can be uniquely represented by a
    Zhegalkin Polynomial (Algebraic Normal Form). The Zhegalkin
    Polynomial of the boolean function with `n` variables can contain
    up to `2^n` monomials. We can enumerate all the monomials.
    Each monomial is fully specified by the presence or absence
    of each variable.

    For example, boolean function with four variables ``(a, b, c, d)``
    can contain up to `2^4 = 16` monomials. The 13-th monomial is the
    product ``a & b & d``, because 13 in binary is 1, 1, 0, 1.

    k : int or list of 1's and 0's
    variables : list of variables

    This function simplifies a boolean function to its simplified version
    in SOP or POS form. The return type is an :py:class:`~.Or` or
    :py:class:`~.And` object in SymPy.

    Parameters
    ==========

    expr : Boolean

    form : string (``'cnf'`` or ``'dnf'``) or ``None`` (default).
        If ``'cnf'`` or ``'dnf'``, the simplest expression in the corresponding
        normal form is returned; if ``None``, the answer is returned
        according to the form with fewest args (in CNF by default).

    deep : bool (default ``True``)
        Indicates whether to recursively simplify any
        non-boolean functions contained within the input.

    force : bool (default ``False``)
        As the simplifications require exponential time in the number
        of variables, there is by default a limit on expressions with
        8 variables. When the expression has more than 8 variables
        only symbolical simplification (controlled by ``deep``) is
        made. By setting ``force`` to ``True``, this limit is removed. Be
        aware that this can lead to very long simplification times.

    dontcare : Boolean
        Optimize expression under the assumption that inputs where this
        expression is true are don't care. This is useful in e.g. Piecewise
        conditions, where later conditions do not need to consider inputs that
        are converted by previous conditions. For example, if a previous
        condition is ``And(A, B)``, the simplification of expr can be made
        with don't cares for ``And(A, B)``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.logic import simplify_logic
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
    >>> b = (~x & ~y & ~z) | ( ~x & ~y & z)
    >>> simplify_logic(b)
    ~x & ~y
    >>> simplify_logic(x | y, dontcare=y)
    x

    In the following, the (5, 2, 6) means that there were 6 Or
    functions in which a symbol appeared as itself amongst 5 arguments in
    which there were also 2 negated symbols, e.g. ``(a0 | a1 | a2 | ~a3 | ~a4)``
    is counted once for a0, a1 and a2.

    >>> dict(finger(And(Or(x, And(a, x)), y)))

    So y and x have unique fingerprints, but a and b do not.

def bool_map(bool1, bool2):

    Return the simplified version of *bool1*, and the mapping of variables

    If more than one mappings of this sort exist, one of them
    is returned.

    For example, ``And(x, y)`` is logically equivalent to ``And(a, b)`` for
    the mapping ``{x: a, y: b}`` or ``{x: b, y: a}``.
    If no such mapping exists, return ``False``.

    dominatingvalue : Boolean or ``None``

    Returns
    =======

    int
        Number of gate inputs

    Note
    ====

    Not all Boolean functions count as gate here, only those that are
    considered to be standard gates. These are: :py:class:`~.And`,
    :py:class:`~.Or`, :py:class:`~.Xor`, :py:class:`~.Not`, and
    :py:class:`~.ITE` (multiplexer). :py:class:`~.Nand`, :py:class:`~.Nor`,
    and :py:class:`~.Xnor` will be evaluated to ``Not(And())`` etc.

    ========

    >>> from sympy.logic import And, Or, Nand, Not, gateinputcount
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
    >>> expr = And(x, y)
    >>> gateinputcount(expr)
    2
    >>> gateinputcount(Or(expr, z))
    4

    Note that ``Nand`` is automatically evaluated to ``Not(And())`` so

    >>> gateinputcount(Nand(x, y, z))
    4
    >>> gateinputcount(Not(And(x, y, z)))
    4

    Although this can be avoided by using ``evaluate=False``

    >>> gateinputcount(Nand(x, y, z, evaluate=False))
    3

    Also note that a comparison will count as a Boolean variable:

    >>> gateinputcount(And(x > z, y >= 2))
    2

    As will a symbol:
    >>> gateinputcount(x)
    0

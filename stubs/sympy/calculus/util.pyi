def periodicity(f, symbol, check: bool = False):
    '''
    Tests the given function for periodicity in the given symbol.

    Parameters
    ==========

    f : :py:class:`~.Expr`
        The concerned function.
    symbol : :py:class:`~.Symbol`
        The variable for which the period is to be determined.
    check : bool, optional
        The flag to verify whether the value being returned is a period or not.

    Returns
    =======

    period
        The period of the function is returned.
        ``None`` is returned when the function is aperiodic or has a complex period.
        The value of $0$ is returned as the period of a constant function.

    Raises
    ======

    NotImplementedError
        The value of the period computed cannot be verified.


    Notes
    =====

    Currently, we do not support functions with a complex period.
    The period of functions having complex periodic values such
    as ``exp``, ``sinh`` is evaluated to ``None``.

    The value returned might not be the "fundamental" period of the given
    function i.e. it may not be the smallest periodic value of the function.

    The verification of the period through the ``check`` flag is not reliable
    due to internal simplification of the given expression. Hence, it is set
    to ``False`` by default.

    Examples
    ========
    >>> from sympy import periodicity, Symbol, sin, cos, tan, exp
    >>> x = Symbol(\'x\')
    >>> f = sin(x) + sin(2*x) + sin(3*x)
    >>> periodicity(f, x)
    2*pi
    >>> periodicity(sin(x)*cos(x), x)
    pi
    >>> periodicity(exp(tan(2*x) - 1), x)

    pi

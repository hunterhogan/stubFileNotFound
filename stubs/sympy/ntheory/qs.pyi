    First we iterate over sieve array and look for values which are greater

    In general, let ``t**2 = u*p modN`` and ``r**2 = v*p modN`` be two partial relations

def qs(N, prime_bound, M, ERROR_TERM: int = 25, seed: int = 1234):
    """Performs factorization using Self-Initializing Quadratic Sieve.
    In SIQS, let N be a number to be factored, and this N should not be a
    perfect power. If we find two integers such that ``X**2 = Y**2 modN`` and
    ``X != +-Y modN``, then `gcd(X + Y, N)` will reveal a proper factor of N.
    In order to find these integers X and Y we try to find relations of form
    t**2 = u modN where u is a product of small primes. If we have enough of
    these relations then we can form ``(t1*t2...ti)**2 = u1*u2...ui modN`` such that
    the right hand side is a square, thus we found a relation of ``X**2 = Y**2 modN``.

    Here, several optimizations are done like using multiple polynomials for
    sieving, fast changing between polynomials and using partial relations.
    The use of partial relations can speeds up the factoring by 2 times.

    Parameters
    ==========

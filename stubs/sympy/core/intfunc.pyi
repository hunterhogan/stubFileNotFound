    The algorithm is based on the well known Euclid's algorithm [1]_. To

def igcd_lehmer(a, b):
    """Computes greatest common divisor of two integers.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Euclid's algorithm for the computation of the greatest
    common divisor ``gcd(a, b)``  of two (positive) integers
    $a$ and $b$ is based on the division identity
    $$ a = q \\times b + r$$,
    where the quotient  $q$  and the remainder  $r$  are integers
    and  $0 \\le r < b$. Then each common divisor of  $a$  and  $b$
    divides  $r$, and it follows that  ``gcd(a, b) == gcd(b, r)``.
    The algorithm works by constructing the sequence
    r0, r1, r2, ..., where  r0 = a, r1 = b,  and each  rn
    is the remainder from the division of the two preceding
    elements.

    In Python, ``q = a // b``  and  ``r = a % b``  are obtained by the
    floor division and the remainder operations, respectively.
    These are the most expensive arithmetic operations, especially
    for large  a  and  b.

    Lehmer's algorithm [1]_ is based on the observation that the quotients
    ``qn = r(n-1) // rn``  are in general small integers even
    when  a  and  b  are very large. Hence the quotients can be
    usually determined from a relatively small number of most
    significant bits.

    The efficiency of the algorithm is further enhanced by not
    computing each long remainder in Euclid's sequence. The remainders
    are linear combinations of  a  and  b  with integer coefficients
    derived from the quotients. The coefficients can be computed
    as far as the quotients can be determined from the chosen
    most significant parts of  a  and  b. Only then a new pair of
    consecutive remainders is computed and the algorithm starts
    anew with this pair.

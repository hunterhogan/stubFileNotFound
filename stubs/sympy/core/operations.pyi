        Examples

           This is handy when we want to optimize things, e.g.

               >>> from sympy import Mul, S
               >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
               >>> e = Mul(3, x, y)
               >>> e.args
               (3, x, y)
               >>> Mul(*e.args[1:])
               x*y
               >>> e._new_rawargs(*e.args[1:])  # the same as above, but faster
               x*y

           Note: use this with caution. There is no checking of arguments at
           all. This is best used when you are rebuilding an Add or Mul after
           simply removing one or more args. If, for example, modifications,
           result in extra 1s being inserted they will show up in the result:

               >>> m = (x*y)._new_rawargs(S.One, x); m
               1*x
               >>> m == x
               False
               >>> m.is_Mul
               True

           Another issue to be aware of is that the commutativity of the result
           is based on the commutativity of self. If you are rebuilding the
           terms that came from a commutative object then there will be no
           problem, but if self was non-commutative then what you are
           rebuilding may now be commutative.

           Although this routine tries to do as little as possible with the
           input, getting the commutativity right is important, so this level
           of safety is enforced: commutativity will always be recomputed if
           self is non-commutative and kwarg `reeval=False` has not been
           passed.

        In the example above, "a+sin(b)*c" is the pattern, and "x+sin(y)*z" is
        the expression.

        The repl_dict contains parts that were already matched. For example
        here:

        >>> (x+sin(b)*c)._matches_commutative(x+sin(y)*z, repl_dict={a: x})
        {a_: x, b_: y, c_: z}

        the only function of the repl_dict is to return it in the

        >>> (x+sin(b)*c)._matches_commutative(x+sin(y)*z)
        {b_: y, c_: z}

        the "a: x" is not returned in the result, but otherwise it is

    Join/meet operations of an algebraic lattice[1].

    Explanation
    ===========

    These binary operations are associative (op(op(a, b), c) = op(a, op(b, c))),
    commutative (op(a, b) = op(b, a)) and idempotent (op(a, a) = op(a) = a).
    Common examples are AND, OR, Union, Intersection, max or min. They have an
    identity element (op(identity, a) = a) and an absorbing element
    conventionally called zero (op(zero, a) = zero).

    This is an abstract base class, concrete derived classes must declare
    attributes zero and identity. All defining properties are then respected.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Integer
    >>> from sympy.core.operations import LatticeOp
    >>> class my_join(LatticeOp):
    ...     zero = Integer(0)

    Explanation
    ===========

    If arguments of different types are passed, the classes which handle the operation for each type
    are collected. Then, a class which performs the operation is selected by recursive binary dispatching.
    Dispatching relation can be registered by ``register_handlerclass`` method.

    Priority registration is unordered. You cannot make ``A*B`` and ``B*A`` refer to
    different handler classes. All logic dealing with the order of arguments must be implemented
    in the handler class.

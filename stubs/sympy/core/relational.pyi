class Relational(Boolean, EvalfMixin):
    """Base class for all relation types.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Subclasses of Relational should generally be instantiated directly, but
    Relational can be instantiated with a valid ``rop`` value to dispatch to
    the appropriate subclass.

    Parameters
    ==========

    rop : str or None
        Indicates what subclass to instantiate.  Valid values can be found
        in the keys of Relational.ValidRelationOperator.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Rel
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> Rel(y, x + x**2, '==')
    Eq(y, x**2 + x)

    A relation's type can be defined upon creation using ``rop``.
    The relation type of an existing expression can be obtained
    using its ``rel_op`` property.
    Here is a table of all the relation types, along with their
    ``rop`` and ``rel_op`` values:

    +---------------------+----------------------------+------------+
    |Relation             |``rop``                     |``rel_op``  |
    +=====================+============================+============+
    |``Equality``         |``==`` or ``eq`` or ``None``|``==``      |
    +---------------------+----------------------------+------------+
    |``Unequality``       |``!=`` or ``ne``            |``!=``      |
    +---------------------+----------------------------+------------+
    |``GreaterThan``      |``>=`` or ``ge``            |``>=``      |
    +---------------------+----------------------------+------------+
    |``LessThan``         |``<=`` or ``le``            |``<=``      |
    +---------------------+----------------------------+------------+
    |``StrictGreaterThan``|``>`` or ``gt``             |``>``       |
    +---------------------+----------------------------+------------+
    |``StrictLessThan``   |``<`` or ``lt``             |``<``       |
    +---------------------+----------------------------+------------+

    For example, setting ``rop`` to ``==`` produces an
    ``Equality`` relation, ``Eq()``.
    So does setting ``rop`` to ``eq``, or leaving ``rop`` unspecified.
    That is, the first three ``Rel()`` below all produce the same result.
    Using a ``rop`` from a different row in the table produces a
    different relation type.
    For example, the fourth ``Rel()`` below using ``lt`` for ``rop``
    produces a ``StrictLessThan`` inequality:

    >>> from sympy import Rel
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> Rel(y, x + x**2, '==')
        Eq(y, x**2 + x)
    >>> Rel(y, x + x**2, 'eq')
        Eq(y, x**2 + x)
    >>> Rel(y, x + x**2)
        Eq(y, x**2 + x)
    >>> Rel(y, x + x**2, 'lt')
        y < x**2 + x

    To obtain the relation type of an existing expression,
    get its ``rel_op`` property.
    For example, ``rel_op`` is ``==`` for the ``Equality`` relation above,
    and ``<`` for the strict less than inequality above:

    >>> from sympy import Rel
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> my_equality = Rel(y, x + x**2, '==')
    >>> my_equality.rel_op
        '=='
    >>> my_inequality = Rel(y, x + x**2, 'lt')
    >>> my_inequality.rel_op
        '<'

    sympy.logic.boolalg.Equivalent : for representing equality between two
        boolean expressions

    Notes
    =====

    Python treats 1 and True (and 0 and False) as being equal; SymPy
    does not. And integer will always compare as unequal to a Boolean:

    >>> Eq(True, 1), True == 1
    (False, True)

    This class is not the same as the == operator.  The == operator tests
    for exact structural equality between two expressions; this class
    compares expressions mathematically.

    If either object defines an ``_eval_Eq`` method, it can be used in place of
    the default algorithm.  If ``lhs._eval_Eq(rhs)`` or ``rhs._eval_Eq(lhs)``
    returns anything other than None, that return value will be substituted for
    the Equality.  If None is returned by ``_eval_Eq``, an Equality object will
    be created as usual.

    Since this object is already an expression, it does not respond to
    the method ``as_expr`` if one tries to create `x - y` from ``Eq(x, y)``.
    If ``eq = Eq(x, y)`` then write `eq.lhs - eq.rhs` to get ``x - y``.

    .. deprecated:: 1.5

       ``Eq(expr)`` with a single argument is a shorthand for ``Eq(expr, 0)``,
       but this behavior is deprecated and will be removed in a future version
       of SymPy.

class GreaterThan(_Greater):
    '''Class representations of inequalities.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The ``*Than`` classes represent inequal relationships, where the left-hand
    side is generally bigger or smaller than the right-hand side.  For example,
    the GreaterThan class represents an inequal relationship where the
    left-hand side is at least as big as the right side, if not bigger.  In
    mathematical notation:

    lhs $\\ge$ rhs

    In total, there are four ``*Than`` classes, to represent the four
    inequalities:

    +-----------------+--------+
    |Class Name       | Symbol |
    +=================+========+
    |GreaterThan      | ``>=`` |
    +-----------------+--------+
    |LessThan         | ``<=`` |
    +-----------------+--------+
    |StrictGreaterThan| ``>``  |
    +-----------------+--------+
    |StrictLessThan   | ``<``  |
    +-----------------+--------+

    All classes take two arguments, lhs and rhs.

    +----------------------------+-----------------+
    |Signature Example           | Math Equivalent |
    +============================+=================+
    |GreaterThan(lhs, rhs)       |   lhs $\\ge$ rhs |
    +----------------------------+-----------------+
    |LessThan(lhs, rhs)          |   lhs $\\le$ rhs |
    +----------------------------+-----------------+
    |StrictGreaterThan(lhs, rhs) |   lhs $>$ rhs   |
    +----------------------------+-----------------+
    |StrictLessThan(lhs, rhs)    |   lhs $<$ rhs   |
    +----------------------------+-----------------+

    In addition to the normal .lhs and .rhs of Relations, ``*Than`` inequality
    objects also have the .lts and .gts properties, which represent the "less
    than side" and "greater than side" of the operator.  Use of .lts and .gts
    in an algorithm rather than .lhs and .rhs as an assumption of inequality
    direction will make more explicit the intent of a certain section of code,
    and will make it similarly more robust to client code changes:

    >>> from sympy import GreaterThan, StrictGreaterThan
    >>> from sympy import LessThan, StrictLessThan
    >>> from sympy import And, Ge, Gt, Le, Lt, Rel, S
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
    >>> from sympy.core.relational import Relational

    >>> e = GreaterThan(x, 1)
    >>> e
    x >= 1
    >>> \'%s >= %s is the same as %s <= %s\' % (e.gts, e.lts, e.lts, e.gts)
    \'x >= 1 is the same as 1 <= x\'

    Examples
    ========

    One generally does not instantiate these classes directly, but uses various
    convenience methods:

    >>> for f in [Ge, Gt, Le, Lt]:  # convenience wrappers
    ...     print(f(x, 2))
    x >= 2
    x > 2
    x <= 2
    x < 2

    Another option is to use the Python inequality operators (``>=``, ``>``,
    ``<=``, ``<``) directly.  Their main advantage over the ``Ge``, ``Gt``,
    ``Le``, and ``Lt`` counterparts, is that one can write a more
    "mathematical looking" statement rather than littering the math with
    oddball function calls.  However there are certain (minor) caveats of
    which to be aware (search for \'gotcha\', below).

    >>> x >= 2
    x >= 2
    >>> _ == Ge(x, 2)
    True

    However, it is also perfectly valid to instantiate a ``*Than`` class less
    succinctly and less conveniently:

    >>> Rel(x, 1, ">")
    x > 1
    >>> Relational(x, 1, ">")
    x > 1

    >>> StrictGreaterThan(x, 1)
    x > 1
    >>> GreaterThan(x, 1)
    x >= 1
    >>> LessThan(x, 1)
    x <= 1
    >>> StrictLessThan(x, 1)
    x < 1

    Notes
    =====

    There are a couple of "gotchas" to be aware of when using Python\'s
    operators.

    The first is that what your write is not always what you get:

        >>> 1 < x
        x > 1

        Due to the order that Python parses a statement, it may
        not immediately find two objects comparable.  When ``1 < x``
        is evaluated, Python recognizes that the number 1 is a native
        number and that x is *not*.  Because a native Python number does
        not know how to compare itself with a SymPy object
        Python will try the reflective operation, ``x > 1`` and that is the
        form that gets evaluated, hence returned.

        If the order of the statement is important (for visual output to
        the console, perhaps), one can work around this annoyance in a
        couple ways:

        (1) "sympify" the literal before comparison

        >>> S(1) < x
        1 < x

        (2) use one of the wrappers or less succinct methods described
        above

        >>> Lt(1, x)
        1 < x
        >>> Relational(1, x, "<")
        1 < x

    The second gotcha involves writing equality tests between relationals
    when one or both sides of the test involve a literal relational:

        >>> e = x < 1; e
        x < 1
        >>> e == e  # neither side is a literal
        True
        >>> e == x < 1  # expecting True, too
        False
        >>> e != x < 1  # expecting False
        x < 1
        >>> x < 1 != x < 1  # expecting False or the same thing as before
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: cannot determine truth value of Relational

        The solution for this case is to wrap literal relationals in
        parentheses:

        >>> e == (x < 1)
        True
        >>> e != (x < 1)
        False
        >>> (x < 1) != (x < 1)
        False

    The third gotcha involves chained inequalities not involving
    ``==`` or ``!=``. Occasionally, one may be tempted to write:

        >>> e = x < y < z
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: symbolic boolean expression has no truth value.

        Due to an implementation detail or decision of Python [1]_,
        there is no way for SymPy to create a chained inequality with
        that syntax so one must use And:

        >>> e = And(x < y, y < z)
        >>> type( e )
        And
        >>> e
        (x < y) & (y < z)

        Although this can also be done with the \'&\' operator, it cannot
        be done with the \'and\' operarator:

        >>> (x < y) & (y < z)
        (x < y) & (y < z)
        >>> (x < y) and (y < z)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: cannot determine truth value of Relational

    .. [1] This implementation detail is that Python provides no reliable
       method to determine that a chained inequality is being built.
       Chained comparison operators are evaluated pairwise, using "and"
       logic (see
       https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#not-in). This
       is done in an efficient way, so that each object being compared
       is only evaluated once and the comparison can short-circuit. For
       example, ``1 > 2 > 3`` is evaluated by Python as ``(1 > 2) and (2
       > 3)``. The ``and`` operator coerces each side into a bool,
       returning the object itself when it short-circuits. The bool of
       the --Than operators will raise TypeError on purpose, because
       SymPy cannot determine the mathematical ordering of symbolic
       expressions. Thus, if we were to compute ``x > y > z``, with
       ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` being Symbols, Python converts the
       statement (roughly) into these steps:

        (1) x > y > z
        (2) (x > y) and (y > z)
        (3) (GreaterThanObject) and (y > z)
        (4) (GreaterThanObject.__bool__()) and (y > z)
        (5) TypeError

       Because of the ``and`` added at step 2, the statement gets turned into a
       weak ternary statement, and the first object\'s ``__bool__`` method will
       raise TypeError.  Thus, creating a chained inequality is not possible.

           In Python, there is no way to override the ``and`` operator, or to
           control how it short circuits, so it is impossible to make something
           like ``x > y > z`` work.  There was a PEP to change this,
           :pep:`335`, but it was officially closed in March, 2012.

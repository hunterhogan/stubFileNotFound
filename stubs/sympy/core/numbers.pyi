    not have to precede the decimal point, but there must be a

    exponent of the number which must be an integer, perhaps with

class Number(AtomicExpr):
    """Represents atomic numbers in SymPy.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Floating point numbers are represented by the Float class.
    Rational numbers (of any size) are represented by the Rational class.
    Integer numbers (of any size) are represented by the Integer class.
    Float and Rational are subclasses of Number; Integer is a subclass
    of Rational.

    For example, ``2/3`` is represented as ``Rational(2, 3)`` which is
    a different object from the floating point number obtained with
    Python division ``2/3``. Even for numbers that are exactly
    represented in binary, there is a difference between how two forms,
    such as ``Rational(1, 2)`` and ``Float(0.5)``, are used in SymPy.
    The rational form is to be preferred in symbolic computations.

    Other kinds of numbers, such as algebraic numbers ``sqrt(2)`` or
    complex numbers ``3 + 4*I``, are not instances of Number class as
    they are not atomic.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Float
    >>> Float(3.5)
    3.50000000000000
    >>> Float(3)
    3.00000000000000

    Creating Floats from strings (and Python ``int`` and ``long``
    types) will give a minimum precision of 15 digits, but the
    precision will automatically increase to capture all digits
    entered.

    >>> Float(1)
    1.00000000000000
    >>> Float(10**20)
    100000000000000000000.
    >>> Float(\'1e20\')
    100000000000000000000.

    However, *floating-point* numbers (Python ``float`` types) retain
    only 15 digits of precision:

    >>> Float(1e20)
    1.00000000000000e+20
    >>> Float(1.23456789123456789)
    1.23456789123457

    It may be preferable to enter high-precision decimal numbers
    as strings:

    >>> Float(\'1.23456789123456789\')
    1.23456789123456789

    The desired number of digits can also be specified:

    >>> Float(\'1e-3\', 3)
    0.00100
    >>> Float(100, 4)
    100.0

    Float can automatically count significant figures if a null string
    is sent for the precision; spaces or underscores are also allowed. (Auto-
    counting is only allowed for strings, ints and longs).

    >>> Float(\'123 456 789.123_456\', \'\')
    123456789.123456
    >>> Float(\'12e-3\', \'\')
    0.012
    >>> Float(3, \'\')
    3.

    If a number is written in scientific notation, only the digits before the
    exponent are considered significant if a decimal appears, otherwise the
    "e" signifies only how to move the decimal:

    >>> Float(\'60.e2\', \'\')  # 2 digits significant
    6.0e+3
    >>> Float(\'60e2\', \'\')  # 4 digits significant
    6000.
    >>> Float(\'600e-2\', \'\')  # 3 digits significant
    6.00

    Notes
    =====

    Floats are inexact by their nature unless their value is a binary-exact
    value.

    >>> approx, exact = Float(.1, 1), Float(.125, 1)

    For calculation purposes, evalf needs to be able to change the precision
    but this will not increase the accuracy of the inexact value. The
    following is the most accurate 5-digit approximation of a value of 0.1
    that had only 1 digit of precision:

    >>> approx.evalf(5)
    0.099609

    By contrast, 0.125 is exact in binary (as it is in base 10) and so it
    can be passed to Float or evalf to obtain an arbitrary precision with
    matching accuracy:

    >>> Float(exact, 5)
    0.12500
    >>> exact.evalf(20)
    0.12500000000000000000

    Trying to make a high-precision Float from a float is not disallowed,
    but one must keep in mind that the *underlying float* (not the apparent
    decimal value) is being obtained with high precision. For example, 0.3
    does not have a finite binary representation. The closest rational is
    the fraction 5404319552844595/2**54. So if you try to obtain a Float of
    0.3 to 20 digits of precision you will not see the same thing as 0.3
    followed by 19 zeros:

    >>> Float(0.3, 20)
    0.29999999999999998890

    If you want a 20-digit value of the decimal 0.3 (not the floating point
    approximation of 0.3) you should send the 0.3 as a string. The underlying
    representation is still binary but a higher precision than Python\'s float
    is used:

    >>> Float(\'0.3\', 20)
    0.30000000000000000000

    Although you can increase the precision of an existing Float using Float
    it will not increase the accuracy -- the underlying value is not changed:

    >>> def show(f): # binary rep of Float
    ...     from sympy import Mul, Pow
    ...     s, m, e, b = f._mpf_
    ...     v = Mul(int(m), Pow(2, int(e), evaluate=False), evaluate=False)
    ...     print(\'%s at prec=%s\' % (v, f._prec))
    ...
    >>> t = Float(\'0.3\', 3)
    >>> show(t)
    4915/2**14 at prec=13
    >>> show(Float(t, 20)) # higher prec, not higher accuracy
    4915/2**14 at prec=70
    >>> show(Float(t, 2)) # lower prec
    307/2**10 at prec=10

    The same thing happens when evalf is used on a Float:

    >>> show(t.evalf(20))
    4915/2**14 at prec=70
    >>> show(t.evalf(2))
    307/2**10 at prec=10

    Finally, Floats can be instantiated with an mpf tuple (n, c, p) to
    produce the number (-1)**n*c*2**p:

    >>> n, c, p = 1, 5, 0
    >>> (-1)**n*c*2**p
    -5
    >>> Float((1, 5, 0))
    -5.00000000000000

    An actual mpf tuple also contains the number of bits in c as the last
    element of the tuple:

    >>> _._mpf_
    (1, 5, 0, 3)

    This is not needed for instantiation and is not the same thing as the
    precision. The mpf tuple and the precision are two separate quantities
    that Float tracks.

    In SymPy, a Float is a number that can be computed with arbitrary
    precision. Although floating point \'inf\' and \'nan\' are not such
    numbers, Float can create these numbers:

    >>> Float(\'-inf\')
    -oo
    >>> _.is_Float
    False

    Zero in Float only has a single value. Values are not separate for
    positive and negative zeroes.

    >>> from sympy import Rational, nsimplify, S, pi

    Rational is unprejudiced in accepting input. If a float is passed, the
    underlying value of the binary representation will be returned:

    >>> Rational(.5)
    1/2
    >>> Rational(.2)
    3602879701896397/18014398509481984

    If the simpler representation of the float is desired then consider
    limiting the denominator to the desired value or convert the float to
    a string (which is roughly equivalent to limiting the denominator to
    10**12):

    >>> Rational(str(.2))
    1/5
    >>> Rational(.2).limit_denominator(10**12)
    1/5

    An arbitrarily precise Rational is obtained when a string literal is
    passed:

    >>> Rational("1.23")
    123/100
    >>> Rational(\'1e-2\')
    1/100
    >>> Rational(".1")
    1/10
    >>> Rational(\'1e-2/3.2\')
    1/320

    The conversion of other types of strings can be handled by
    the sympify() function, and conversion of floats to expressions
    or simple fractions can be handled with nsimplify:

    >>> S(\'.[3]\')  # repeating digits in brackets
    1/3
    >>> S(\'3**2/10\')  # general expressions
    9/10
    >>> nsimplify(.3)  # numbers that have a simple form
    3/10

    But if the input does not reduce to a literal Rational, an error will
    be raised:

    >>> Rational(pi)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: invalid input: pi

    >>> r = Rational(3, 4)

    4

    Note that p and q return integers (not SymPy Integers) so some care
    is needed when using them in expressions:

    >>> r.p/r.q
    0.75

    If an unevaluated Rational is desired, ``gcd=1`` can be passed and
    this will keep common divisors of the numerator and denominator
    from being eliminated. It is not possible, however, to leave a
    negative value in the denominator.

    >>> Integer("9" * 20)
    99999999999999999999

    It is rarely needed to explicitly instantiate an Integer, because
    Python integers are automatically converted to Integer when they
    are used in SymPy expressions.

        Explanation
        ===========

        When exponent is a fraction (so we have for example a square root),
        we try to find a simpler representation by factoring the argument
        up to factors of 2**15, e.g.

          - sqrt(4) becomes 2
          - sqrt(-4) becomes 2*I
          - (2**(3+7)*3**(6+7))**Rational(1,7) becomes 6*18**(3/7)

        Further simplification would require a special call to factorint on
        the argument which is not done here for sake of speed.

        Parameters
        ==========

        expr : :py:class:`~.Expr`, or pair $(m, r)$
            There are three distinct modes of construction, depending on what
            is passed as *expr*.

            **(1)** *expr* is an :py:class:`~.AlgebraicNumber`:
            In this case we begin by copying all four instance attributes from
            *expr*. If *coeffs* were also given, we compose the two coeff
            polynomials (see below). If an *alias* was given, it overrides.

            **(2)** *expr* is any other type of :py:class:`~.Expr`:
            Then ``root`` will equal *expr*. Therefore it
            must express an algebraic quantity, and we will compute its
            ``minpoly``.

            **(3)** *expr* is an ordered pair $(m, r)$ giving the
            ``minpoly`` $m$, and a ``root`` $r$ thereof, which together
            define $\\theta$. In this case $m$ may be either a univariate
            :py:class:`~.Poly` or any :py:class:`~.Expr` which represents the
            same, while $r$ must be some :py:class:`~.Expr` representing a
            complex number that is a root of $m$, including both explicit
            expressions in radicals, and instances of
            :py:class:`~.ComplexRootOf` or :py:class:`~.AlgebraicNumber`.

        coeffs : list, :py:class:`~.ANP`, None, optional (default=None)
            This defines ``rep``, giving the algebraic number $\\alpha$ as a
            polynomial in $\\theta$.

            If a list, the elements should be integers or rational numbers.
            If an :py:class:`~.ANP`, we take its coefficients (using its
            :py:meth:`~.ANP.to_list()` method). If ``None``, then the list of
            coefficients defaults to ``[1, 0]``, meaning that $\\alpha = \\theta$
            is the primitive element of the field.

            If *expr* was an :py:class:`~.AlgebraicNumber`, let $g(x)$ be its
            ``rep`` polynomial, and let $f(x)$ be the polynomial defined by
            *coeffs*. Then ``self.rep`` will represent the composition
            $(f \\circ g)(x)$.

        alias : str, :py:class:`~.Symbol`, None, optional (default=None)
            This is a way to provide a name for the primitive element. We
            described several ways in which the *expr* argument can define the
            value of the primitive element, but none of these methods gave it
            a name. Here, for example, *alias* could be set as
            ``Symbol('theta')``, in order to make this symbol appear when
            $\\alpha$ is printed, or rendered as a polynomial, using the
            :py:meth:`~.as_poly()` method.

        Examples
        ========

        Recall that we are constructing an algebraic number as a field element
        $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\theta)$.

        >>> from sympy import AlgebraicNumber, sqrt, CRootOf, S
        >>> from sympy.abc import x

        Example (1): $\\alpha = \\theta = \\sqrt{2}$

        >>> a1 = AlgebraicNumber(sqrt(2))
        >>> a1.minpoly_of_element().as_expr(x)
        x**2 - 2
        >>> a1.evalf(10)
        1.414213562

        Example (2): $\\alpha = 3 \\sqrt{2} - 5$, $\\theta = \\sqrt{2}$. We can
        either build on the last example:

        >>> a2 = AlgebraicNumber(a1, [3, -5])
        >>> a2.as_expr()
        -5 + 3*sqrt(2)

        or start from scratch:

        >>> a2 = AlgebraicNumber(sqrt(2), [3, -5])
        >>> a2.as_expr()
        -5 + 3*sqrt(2)

        Example (3): $\\alpha = 6 \\sqrt{2} - 11$, $\\theta = \\sqrt{2}$. Again we
        can build on the previous example, and we see that the coeff polys are
        composed:

        >>> a3 = AlgebraicNumber(a2, [2, -1])
        >>> a3.as_expr()
        -11 + 6*sqrt(2)

        reflecting the fact that $(2x - 1) \\circ (3x - 5) = 6x - 11$.

        Example (4): $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\theta = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$. The
        easiest way is to use the :py:func:`~.to_number_field()` function:

        >>> from sympy import to_number_field
        >>> a4 = to_number_field(sqrt(2), sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))
        >>> a4.minpoly_of_element().as_expr(x)
        x**2 - 2
        >>> a4.to_root()
        sqrt(2)
        >>> a4.primitive_element()
        sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)
        >>> a4.coeffs()
        [1/2, 0, -9/2, 0]

        but if you already knew the right coefficients, you could construct it
        directly:

        >>> a4 = AlgebraicNumber(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3), [S(1)/2, 0, S(-9)/2, 0])
        >>> a4.to_root()
        sqrt(2)
        >>> a4.primitive_element()
        sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)

        Example (5): Construct the Golden Ratio as an element of the 5th
        cyclotomic field, supposing we already know its coefficients. This time
        we introduce the alias $\\zeta$ for the primitive element of the field:

        >>> from sympy import cyclotomic_poly
        >>> from sympy.abc import zeta
        >>> a5 = AlgebraicNumber(CRootOf(cyclotomic_poly(5), -1),
        ...                  [-1, -1, 0, 0], alias=zeta)
        >>> a5.as_poly().as_expr()
        -zeta**3 - zeta**2
        >>> a5.evalf()
        1.61803398874989

        (The index ``-1`` to ``CRootOf`` selects the complex root with the
        largest real and imaginary parts, which in this case is
        $\\mathrm{e}^{2i\\pi/5}$. See :py:class:`~.ComplexRootOf`.)

        Example (6): Building on the last example, construct the number
        $2 \\phi \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is the Golden Ratio:

        >>> from sympy.abc import phi
        >>> a6 = AlgebraicNumber(a5.to_root(), coeffs=[2, 0], alias=phi)
        >>> a6.as_poly().as_expr()
        2*phi
        >>> a6.primitive_element().evalf()
        1.61803398874989

        Note that we needed to use ``a5.to_root()``, since passing ``a5`` as
        the first argument would have constructed the number $2 \\phi$ as an
        element of the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta)$:

        >>> a6_wrong = AlgebraicNumber(a5, coeffs=[2, 0])
        >>> a6_wrong.as_poly().as_expr()
        -2*zeta**3 - 2*zeta**2
        >>> a6_wrong.primitive_element().evalf()
        0.309016994374947 + 0.951056516295154*I

    """Positive infinite quantity.

    Explanation
    ===========

    In real analysis the symbol `\\infty` denotes an unbounded
    limit: `x\\to\\infty` means that `x` grows without bound.

    Infinity is often used not only to define a limit but as a value
    in the affinely extended real number system.  Points labeled `+\\infty`
    and `-\\infty` can be added to the topological space of the real numbers,
    producing the two-point compactification of the real numbers.  Adding
    algebraic properties to this gives us the extended real numbers.

    Infinity is a singleton, and can be accessed by ``S.Infinity``,
    or can be imported as ``oo``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import oo, exp, limit, Symbol
    >>> 1 + oo
    oo
    >>> 42/oo
    0
    >>> x = Symbol('x')
    >>> limit(exp(x), x, oo)

class NaN(Number, metaclass=Singleton):
    """
    Not a Number.

    Explanation
    ===========

    This serves as a place holder for numeric values that are indeterminate.
    Most operations on NaN, produce another NaN.  Most indeterminate forms,
    such as ``0/0`` or ``oo - oo` produce NaN.  Two exceptions are ``0**0``
    and ``oo**0``, which all produce ``1`` (this is consistent with Python's
    float).

    NaN is loosely related to floating point nan, which is defined in the
    IEEE 754 floating point standard, and corresponds to the Python
    ``float('nan')``.  Differences are noted below.

    NaN is mathematically not equal to anything else, even NaN itself.  This
    explains the initially counter-intuitive results with ``Eq`` and ``==`` in
    the examples below.

    NaN is not comparable so inequalities raise a TypeError.  This is in
    contrast with floating point nan where all inequalities are false.

    NaN is a singleton, and can be accessed by ``S.NaN``, or can be imported
    as ``nan``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import nan, S, oo, Eq
    >>> nan is S.NaN
    True
    >>> oo - oo
    nan
    >>> nan + 1

    >>> Eq(nan, nan)   # mathematical equality

    In SymPy expressions with Floats compare unequal to corresponding

    However an individual Float compares equal to a Rational:

    >>> Rational(1, 2) == Float(0.5)
    False

    In a future version of SymPy this might change so that Rational and Float
    compare unequal. This function provides the behavior currently expected of
    ``==`` so that it could still be used if the behavior of ``==`` were to
    change in future.

    In future SymPy verions Float and Rational might compare unequal and floats
    with different precisions might compare unequal. In that context a function
    is needed that can check if a number is equal to 1 or 0 etc. The idea is
    that instead of testing ``if x == 1:`` if we want to accept floats like
    ``1.0`` as well then the test can be written as ``if equal_valued(x, 1):``
    or ``if equal_valued(x, 2):``. Since this function is intended to be used
    in situations where one or both operands are expected to be concrete
    numbers like 1 or 0 the function does not recurse through the args of any
    compound expression to compare any nested floats.

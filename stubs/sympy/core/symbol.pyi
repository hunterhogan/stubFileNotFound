    Represents string in SymPy.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Previously, ``Symbol`` was used where string is needed in ``args`` of SymPy
    objects, e.g. denoting the name of the instance. However, since ``Symbol``
    represents mathematical scalar, this class should be used instead.

    >>> _symbol(x, real=True)
    x
    >>> _.is_real is None  # ignore attribute if s is a Symbol
    True

    Below, the variable sym has the name 'foo':

    >>> sym = Symbol('foo', real=True)

    Since 'x' is not the same as sym's name, a new symbol is created:

    >>> _symbol('x', sym).name
    'x'

    It will acquire any assumptions give:

    >>> _symbol('x', sym, real=False).is_real
    False

    Since 'foo' is the same as sym's name, sym is returned

    >>> _symbol('foo', sym)
    foo

    Any assumptions given are ignored:

    >>> _symbol('foo', sym, real=False).is_real
    True

    NB: the symbol here may not be the same as a symbol with the same
    name defined elsewhere as a result of different assumptions.

    Return a symbol whose name is derivated from *xname* but is unique

    *xname* and symbol names in *exprs* are passed to *compare* to be
    converted to comparable forms. If ``compare(xname)`` is not unique,
    it is recursively passed to *modify* until unique name is acquired.

    Parameters
    ==========

    xname : str or Symbol
        Base name for the new symbol.

    exprs : Expr or iterable of Expr
        Expressions whose symbols are compared to *xname*.

    compare : function
        Unary function which transforms *xname* and symbol names from
        *exprs* to comparable form.

    modify : function
        Unary function which modifies the string. Default is appending
        the number, or increasing the number if exists.

    Examples
    ========

    By default, a number is appended to *xname* to generate unique name.

    Symbol class is used to create symbolic variables.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Symbolic variables are placeholders for mathematical symbols that can represent numbers, constants, or any other mathematical entities and can be used in mathematical expressions and to perform symbolic computations.

    Assumptions:

    commutative = True
    positive = True
    real = True
    imaginary = True
    complex = True
    complete list of more assumptions- :ref:`predicates`

    You can override the default assumptions in the constructor.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Symbol
    >>> x = Symbol("x", positive=True)
    >>> x.is_positive
    True
    >>> x.is_negative
    False

    passing in greek letters:

    >>> from sympy import Symbol
    >>> alpha = Symbol(\'alpha\')
    >>> alpha #doctest: +SKIP
    α

    Trailing digits are automatically treated like subscripts of what precedes them in the name.
    General format to add subscript to a symbol :
    ``<var_name> = Symbol(\'<symbol_name>_<subscript>\')``

class Wild(Symbol):

    A Wild symbol matches anything, or anything

    Parameters
    ==========

    name : str
        Name of the Wild instance.

    exclude : iterable, optional
        Instances in ``exclude`` will not be matched.

    properties : iterable of functions, optional
        Functions, each taking an expressions as input
        and returns a ``bool``. All functions in ``properties``
        need to return ``True`` in order for the Wild instance
        to match the expression.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Wild, WildFunction, cos, pi
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
    >>> a = Wild('a')
    >>> x.match(a)
    {a_: x}
    >>> pi.match(a)
    {a_: pi}
    >>> (3*x**2).match(a*x)
    {a_: 3*x}
    >>> cos(x).match(a)
    {a_: cos(x)}
    >>> b = Wild('b', exclude=[x])
    >>> (3*x**2).match(b*x)
    >>> b.match(a)
    {a_: b_}
    >>> A = WildFunction('A')
    >>> A.match(a)
    {a_: A_}

    Tips
    ====

    When using Wild, be sure to use the exclude
    keyword to make the pattern more precise.
    Without the exclude pattern, you may get matches
    that are technically correct, but not what you
    wanted. For example, using the above without
    exclude:

    >>> from sympy import symbols
    >>> a, b = symbols('a b', cls=Wild)
    >>> (2 + 3*y).match(a*x + b*y)
    {a_: 2/x, b_: 3}

    This is technically correct, because
    (2/x)*x + 3*y == 2 + 3*y, but you probably
    wanted it to not match at all. The issue is that
    you really did not want a and b to include x and y,
    and the exclude parameter lets you specify exactly
    this.  With the exclude parameter, the pattern will
    not match.

    >>> a = Wild('a', exclude=[x, y])
    >>> b = Wild('b', exclude=[x, y])
    >>> (2 + 3*y).match(a*x + b*y)

    Exclude also helps remove ambiguity from matches.

    >>> E = 2*x**3*y*z
    >>> a, b = symbols('a b', cls=Wild)
    >>> E.match(a*b)
    {a_: 2*y*z, b_: x**3}
    >>> a = Wild('a', exclude=[x, y])
    >>> E.match(a*b)
    {a_: z, b_: 2*x**3*y}
    >>> a = Wild('a', exclude=[x, y, z])
    >>> E.match(a*b)
    {a_: 2, b_: x**3*y*z}

    Wild also accepts a ``properties`` parameter:

    >>> a = Wild('a', properties=[lambda k: k.is_Integer])
    >>> E.match(a*b)
    {a_: 2, b_: x**3*y*z}

    Transform strings into instances of :class:`Symbol` class.

    :func:`symbols` function returns a sequence of symbols with names taken
    from ``names`` argument, which can be a comma or whitespace delimited
    string, or a sequence of strings::

        >>> from sympy import symbols, Function

        >>> x, y, z = symbols('x,y,z')
        >>> a, b, c = symbols('a b c')

    The type of output is dependent on the properties of input arguments::

        >>> symbols('x')
        x
        >>> symbols('x,')
        (x,)
        >>> symbols('x,y')

        [a, b, c]
        >>> symbols({'a', 'b', 'c'})
        {a, b, c}

    If an iterable container is needed for a single symbol, set the ``seq``
    argument to ``True`` or terminate the symbol name with a comma::

        >>> symbols('x', seq=True)
        (x,)

    To reduce typing, range syntax is supported to create indexed symbols.
    Ranges are indicated by a colon and the type of range is determined by
    the character to the right of the colon. If the character is a digit
    then all contiguous digits to the left are taken as the nonnegative
    starting value (or 0 if there is no digit left of the colon) and all
    contiguous digits to the right are taken as 1 greater than the ending
    value::

        >>> symbols('x:10')
        (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9)

        >>> symbols('x5:10')
        (x5, x6, x7, x8, x9)
        >>> symbols('x5(:2)')
        (x50, x51)

        >>> symbols('x5:10,y:5')
        (x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, y0, y1, y2, y3, y4)

        >>> symbols(('x5:10', 'y:5'))
        ((x5, x6, x7, x8, x9), (y0, y1, y2, y3, y4))

    If the character to the right of the colon is a letter, then the single
    letter to the left (or 'a' if there is none) is taken as the start
    and all characters in the lexicographic range *through* the letter to
    the right are used as the range::

        >>> symbols('x:z')
        (x, y, z)
        >>> symbols('x:c')  # null range
        ()
        >>> symbols('x(:c)')
        (xa, xb, xc)

        >>> symbols(':c')
        (a, b, c)

        >>> symbols('a:d, x:z')
        (a, b, c, d, x, y, z)

        >>> symbols(('a:d', 'x:z'))
        ((a, b, c, d), (x, y, z))

    Multiple ranges are supported; contiguous numerical ranges should be
    separated by parentheses to disambiguate the ending number of one
    range from the starting number of the next::

        >>> symbols('x:2(1:3)')
        (x01, x02, x11, x12)
        >>> symbols(':3:2')  # parsing is from left to right
        (00, 01, 10, 11, 20, 21)

    Only one pair of parentheses surrounding ranges are removed, so to
    include parentheses around ranges, double them. And to include spaces,
    commas, or colons, escape them with a backslash::

        >>> symbols('x((a:b))')
        (x(a), x(b))
        >>> symbols(r'x(:1\\,:2)')  # or r'x((:1)\\,(:2))'
        (x(0,0), x(0,1))

    All newly created symbols have assumptions set according to ``args``::

        >>> a = symbols('a', integer=True)
        >>> a.is_integer
        True

        >>> x, y, z = symbols('x,y,z', real=True)
        >>> x.is_real and y.is_real and z.is_real
        True

    Despite its name, :func:`symbols` can create symbol-like objects like
    instances of Function or Wild classes. To achieve this, set ``cls``
    keyword argument to the desired type::

        >>> symbols('f,g,h', cls=Function)
        (f, g, h)

        >>> type(_[0])

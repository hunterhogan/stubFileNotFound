    '''Fast approximation of log2(x) for an mpf value tuple x.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Calculated as exponent + width of mantissa. This is an
    approximation for two reasons: 1) it gives the ceil(log2(abs(x)))
    value and 2) it is too high by 1 in the case that x is an exact
    power of 2. Although this is easy to remedy by testing to see if
    the odd mpf mantissa is 1 (indicating that one was dealing with
    an exact power of 2) that would decrease the speed and is not
    necessary as this is only being used as an approximation for the
    number of bits in x. The correct return value could be written as
    "x[2] + (x[3] if x[1] != 1 else 0)".
        Since mpf tuples always have an odd mantissa, no check is done
    to see if the mantissa is a multiple of 2 (in which case the
    result would be too large by 1).

        Parameters
        ==========

        subs : dict, optional
            Substitute numerical values for symbols, e.g.
            ``subs={x:3, y:1+pi}``. The substitutions must be given as a
            dictionary.

        maxn : int, optional
            Allow a maximum temporary working precision of maxn digits.

        chop : bool or number, optional
            Specifies how to replace tiny real or imaginary parts in
            subresults by exact zeros.

            When ``True`` the chop value defaults to standard precision.

            Otherwise the chop value is used to determine the
            magnitude of "small" for purposes of chopping.

            >>> from sympy import N
            >>> x = 1e-4
            >>> N(x, chop=True)
            0.000100000000000000
            >>> N(x, chop=1e-5)
            0.000100000000000000
            >>> N(x, chop=1e-4)
            0

        strict : bool, optional
            Raise ``PrecisionExhausted`` if any subresult fails to
            evaluate to full accuracy, given the available maxprec.

        quad : str, optional
            Choose algorithm for numerical quadrature. By default,
            tanh-sinh quadrature is used. For oscillatory
            integrals on an infinite interval, try ``quad=\'osc\'``.

        verbose : bool, optional
            Print debug information.

        Notes
        =====

        When Floats are naively substituted into an expression,
        precision errors may adversely affect the result. For example,
        adding 1e16 (a Float) to 1 will truncate to 1e16; if 1e16 is
        then subtracted, the result will be 0.
        That is exactly what happens in the following:

        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
        >>> values = {x: 1e16, y: 1, z: 1e16}
        >>> (x + y - z).subs(values)
        0

        Using the subs argument for evalf is the accurate way to
        evaluate such an expression:

        >>> (x + y - z).evalf(subs=values)
        1.00000000000000

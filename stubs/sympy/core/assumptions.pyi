    given (or possessed by ``against``). True is returned if all
    assumptions match; False is returned if there is a mismatch and
    the assumption in ``expr`` is not None; else None is returned.

    Explanation
    ===========

    *assume* is a dict of assumptions with True or False values

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Symbol, pi, I, exp, check_assumptions
    >>> check_assumptions(-5, integer=True)
    True
    >>> check_assumptions(pi, real=True, integer=False)
    True
    >>> check_assumptions(pi, negative=True)
    False
    >>> check_assumptions(exp(I*pi/7), real=False)
    True
    >>> x = Symbol('x', positive=True)
    >>> check_assumptions(2*x + 1, positive=True)
    True
    >>> check_assumptions(-2*x - 5, positive=True)
    False

    To check assumptions of *expr* against another variable or expression,
    pass the expression or variable as ``against``.

    >>> check_assumptions(2*x + 1, x)
    True

    To see if a number matches the assumptions of an expression, pass
    the number as the first argument, else its specific assumptions
    may not have a non-None value in the expression:

    >>> check_assumptions(x, 3)
    >>> check_assumptions(3, x)
    True

    ``None`` is returned if ``check_assumptions()`` could not conclude.

    >>> check_assumptions(2*x - 1, x)

    >>> z = Symbol('z')
    >>> check_assumptions(z, real=True)

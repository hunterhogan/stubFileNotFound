    This class represent the dimension of a physical quantities.

    The ``Dimension`` constructor takes as parameters a name and an optional
    symbol.

    For example, in classical mechanics we know that time is different from
    temperature and dimensions make this difference (but they do not provide
    any measure of these quantites.

        >>> from sympy.physics.units import Dimension
        >>> length = Dimension('length')
        >>> length
        Dimension(length)
        >>> time = Dimension('time')
        >>> time
        Dimension(time)

    Dimensions can be composed using multiplication, division and
    exponentiation (by a number) to give new dimensions. Addition and
    subtraction is defined only when the two objects are the same dimension.

        >>> velocity = length / time
        >>> velocity
        Dimension(length/time)

    It is possible to use a dimension system object to get the dimensionsal
    dependencies of a dimension, for example the dimension system used by the
    SI units convention can be used:

        >>> from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import dimsys_SI
        >>> dimsys_SI.get_dimensional_dependencies(velocity)
        {Dimension(length, L): 1, Dimension(time, T): -1}
        >>> length + length
        Dimension(length)
        >>> l2 = length**2
        >>> l2
        Dimension(length**2)
        >>> dimsys_SI.get_dimensional_dependencies(l2)
        {Dimension(length, L): 2}

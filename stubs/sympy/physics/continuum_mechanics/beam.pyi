class Beam:
    '''
    A Beam is a structural element that is capable of withstanding load
    primarily by resisting against bending. Beams are characterized by
    their cross sectional profile(Second moment of area), their length
    and their material.

    .. note::
       A consistent sign convention must be used while solving a beam
       bending problem; the results will
       automatically follow the chosen sign convention. However, the
       chosen sign convention must respect the rule that, on the positive
       side of beam\'s axis (in respect to current section), a loading force
       giving positive shear yields a negative moment, as below (the
       curved arrow shows the positive moment and rotation):

    Examples
    ========
    There is a beam of length 4 meters. A constant distributed load of 6 N/m
    is applied from half of the beam till the end. There are two simple supports
    below the beam, one at the starting point and another at the ending point
    of the beam. The deflection of the beam at the end is restricted.

    Using the sign convention of downwards forces being positive.

    >>> from sympy import symbols, Piecewise

         + Piecewise(((x - 2)**4, x >= 2), (0, True))/4)/(E*I)

    Calculate the support reactions for a fully symbolic beam of length L.
    There are two simple supports below the beam, one at the starting point
    and another at the ending point of the beam. The deflection of the beam
    at the end is restricted. The beam is loaded with:

    * a downward point load P1 applied at L/4
    * an upward point load P2 applied at L/8
    * a counterclockwise moment M1 applied at L/2
    * a clockwise moment M2 applied at 3*L/4
    * a distributed constant load q1, applied downward, starting from L/2
      up to 3*L/4
    * a distributed constant load q2, applied upward, starting from 3*L/4
      up to L

    No assumptions are needed for symbolic loads. However, defining a positive
    length will help the algorithm to compute the solution.

        Parameters
        ==========

        length : Sympifyable
            A Symbol or value representing the Beam's length.

        elastic_modulus : Sympifyable
            A SymPy expression representing the Beam's Modulus of Elasticity.
            It is a measure of the stiffness of the Beam material. It can
            also be a continuous function of position along the beam.

        second_moment : Sympifyable or Geometry object
            Describes the cross-section of the beam via a SymPy expression
            representing the Beam's second moment of area. It is a geometrical
            property of an area which reflects how its points are distributed
            with respect to its neutral axis. It can also be a continuous
            function of position along the beam. Alternatively ``second_moment``
            can be a shape object such as a ``Polygon`` from the geometry module
            representing the shape of the cross-section of the beam. In such cases,
            it is assumed that the x-axis of the shape object is aligned with the
            bending axis of the beam. The second moment of area will be computed
            from the shape object internally.

        area : Symbol/float
            Represents the cross-section area of beam

        variable : Symbol, optional
            A Symbol object that will be used as the variable along the beam
            while representing the load, shear, moment, slope and deflection
            curve. By default, it is set to ``Symbol('x')``.

        base_char : String, optional
            A String that will be used as base character to generate sequential
            symbols for integration constants in cases where boundary conditions
            are not sufficient to solve them.

    def draw(self, pictorial: bool = True):
        '''
        Returns a plot object representing the beam diagram of the beam.
        In particular, the diagram might include:

        * the beam.
        * vertical black arrows represent point loads and support reaction
          forces (the latter if they have been added with the ``apply_load``
          method).
        * circular arrows represent moments.
        * shaded areas represent distributed loads.
        * the support, if ``apply_support`` has been executed.
        * if a composite beam has been created with the ``join`` method and
          a hinge has been specified, it will be shown with a white disc.

        The diagram shows positive loads on the upper side of the beam,
        and negative loads on the lower side. If two or more distributed
        loads acts along the same direction over the same region, the
        function will add them up together.

        .. note::
            The user must be careful while entering load values.
            The draw function assumes a sign convention which is used
            for plotting loads.
            Given a right handed coordinate system with XYZ coordinates,
            the beam\'s length is assumed to be along the positive X axis.
            The draw function recognizes positive loads(with n>-2) as loads
            acting along negative Y direction and positive moments acting
            along positive Z direction.

        Parameters
        ==========

        pictorial: Boolean (default=True)
            Setting ``pictorial=True`` would simply create a pictorial (scaled)
            view of the beam diagram. On the other hand, ``pictorial=False``
            would create a beam diagram with the exact dimensions on the plot.

    This class handles loads applied in any direction of a 3D space along

    .. note::
       A consistent sign convention must be used while solving a beam
       bending problem; the results will
       automatically follow the chosen sign convention.
       This class assumes that any kind of distributed load/moment is
       applied through out the span of a beam.

    Examples
    ========
    There is a beam of l meters long. A constant distributed load of magnitude q
    is applied along y-axis from start till the end of beam. A constant distributed
    moment of magnitude m is also applied along z-axis from start till the end of beam.
    Beam is fixed at both of its end. So, deflection of the beam at the both ends
    is restricted.

        Returns point of max deflection and its corresponding deflection value

        Examples
        ========
        There is a beam of length 20 meters. It is supported by rollers
        at both of its ends. A linear load having slope equal to 12 is applied
        along y-axis. A constant distributed load of magnitude 15 N is
        applied from start till its end along z-axis.

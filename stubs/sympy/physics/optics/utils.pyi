def refraction_angle(incident, medium1, medium2, normal: Incomplete | None = None, plane: Incomplete | None = None):
    """
    This function calculates transmitted vector after refraction at planar
    surface. ``medium1`` and ``medium2`` can be ``Medium`` or any sympifiable object.
    If ``incident`` is a number then treated as angle of incidence (in radians)
    in which case refraction angle is returned.

    If ``incident`` is an object of `Ray3D`, `normal` also has to be an instance
    of `Ray3D` in order to get the output as a `Ray3D`. Please note that if
    plane of separation is not provided and normal is an instance of `Ray3D`,
    ``normal`` will be assumed to be intersecting incident ray at the plane of
    separation. This will not be the case when `normal` is a `Matrix` or
    any other sequence.
    If ``incident`` is an instance of `Ray3D` and `plane` has not been provided
    and ``normal`` is not `Ray3D`, output will be a `Matrix`.

def fresnel_coefficients(angle_of_incidence, medium1, medium2):
    """
    This function uses Fresnel equations to calculate reflection and
    transmission coefficients. Those are obtained for both polarisations
    when the electric field vector is in the plane of incidence (labelled 'p')
    and when the electric field vector is perpendicular to the plane of
    incidence (labelled 's'). There are four real coefficients unless the
    incident ray reflects in total internal in which case there are two complex
    ones. Angle of incidence is the angle between the incident ray and the
    surface normal. ``medium1`` and ``medium2`` can be ``Medium`` or any
    sympifiable object.

    Parameters
    ==========

    angle_of_incidence : sympifiable

    medium1 : Medium or sympifiable
        Medium 1 or its refractive index

    Returns
    =======

    Returns a list with four real Fresnel coefficients:
    [reflection p (TM), reflection s (TE),
    transmission p (TM), transmission s (TE)]
    If the ray is undergoes total internal reflection then returns a
    list of two complex Fresnel coefficients:

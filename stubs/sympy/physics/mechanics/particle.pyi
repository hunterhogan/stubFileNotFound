    Explanation
    ===========

    Particles have a non-zero mass and lack spatial extension; they take up no
    space.

    Values need to be supplied on initialization, but can be changed later.

    Parameters
    ==========

    name : str
        Name of particle
    point : Point
        A physics/mechanics Point which represents the position, velocity, and
        acceleration of this Particle
    mass : Sympifyable
        A SymPy expression representing the Particle's mass
    potential_energy : Sympifyable
        The potential energy of the Particle.

    Examples
    ========

        Explanation

        The linear momentum L, of a particle P, with respect to frame N is
        given by:

        L = m * v

        where m is the mass of the particle, and v is the velocity of the
        particle in the frame N.

        Parameters
        ==========

        frame : ReferenceFrame
            The frame in which linear momentum is desired.

        ===========

        The angular momentum H, about some point O of a particle, P, is given
        by:

        ``H = cross(r, m * v)``

        where r is the position vector from point O to the particle P, m is
        the mass of the particle, and v is the velocity of the particle in
        the inertial frame, N.

            The point about which angular momentum of the particle is desired.

        Explanation
        ===========

        The kinetic energy, T, of a particle, P, is given by:

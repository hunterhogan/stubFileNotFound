def find_dynamicsymbols(expression, exclude=None, reference_frame=None):
    """Find all dynamicsymbols in expression.

    Explanation
    ===========

    If the optional ``exclude`` kwarg is used, only dynamicsymbols
    not in the iterable ``exclude`` are returned.
    If we intend to apply this function on a vector, the optional
    ``reference_frame`` is also used to inform about the corresponding frame
    with respect to which the dynamic symbols of the given vector is to be
    determined.

    Parameters
    ==========

    expression : SymPy expression

    exclude : iterable of dynamicsymbols, optional

    reference_frame : ReferenceFrame, optional
        The frame with respect to which the dynamic symbols of the
        given vector is to be determined.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import dynamicsymbols, find_dynamicsymbols
    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import ReferenceFrame
    >>> x, y = dynamicsymbols('x, y')
    >>> expr = x + x.diff()*y
    >>> find_dynamicsymbols(expr)

def msubs(expr, *sub_dicts, smart: bool = False, **kwargs):
    """A custom subs for use on expressions derived in physics.mechanics.

    Traverses the expression tree once, performing the subs found in sub_dicts.
    Terms inside ``Derivative`` expressions are ignored:

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import dynamicsymbols, msubs
    >>> x = dynamicsymbols('x')
    >>> msubs(x.diff() + x, {x: 1})
    Derivative(x(t), t) + 1

    Note that sub_dicts can be a single dictionary, or several dictionaries:

    >>> x, y, z = dynamicsymbols('x, y, z')

    >>> sub2 = {z: 3, x.diff(): 4}

    10

    If smart=True (default False), also checks for conditions that may result
    in ``nan``, but if simplified would yield a valid expression. For example:

    >>> from sympy import sin, tan
    >>> (sin(x)/tan(x)).subs(x, 0)
    nan
    >>> msubs(sin(x)/tan(x), {x: 0}, smart=True)
    1

    It does this by first replacing all ``tan`` with ``sin/cos``. Then each
    node is traversed. If the node is a fraction, subs is first evaluated on
    the denominator. If this results in 0, simplification of the entire
    fraction is attempted. Using this selective simplification, only
    subexpressions that result in 1/0 are targeted, resulting in faster
    performance.

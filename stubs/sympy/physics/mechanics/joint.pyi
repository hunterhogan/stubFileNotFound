class Joint(ABC, metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """Abstract base class for all specific joints.

    Explanation
    ===========

    A joint subtracts degrees of freedom from a body. This is the base class
    for all specific joints and holds all common methods acting as an interface
    for all joints. Custom joint can be created by inheriting Joint class and
    defining all abstract functions.

    The abstract methods are:

    - ``_generate_coordinates``
    - ``_generate_speeds``
    - ``_orient_frames``
    - ``_set_angular_velocity``
    - ``_set_linear_velocity``

    Notes
    =====

    When providing a vector as the intermediate frame, a new intermediate frame
    is created which aligns its X axis with the provided vector. This is done
    with a single fixed rotation about a rotation axis. This rotation axis is
    determined by taking the cross product of the ``body.x`` axis with the
    provided vector. In the case where the provided vector is in the ``-body.x``
    direction, the rotation is done about the ``body.y`` axis.

        sqrt(2)*parent_int_frame.x

        Notes
        =====

        The direction cosine matrix between the given frame and intermediate
        frame is formed using a simple rotation about an axis that is normal to
        both ``align_axis`` and ``frame_axis``. In general, the normal axis is
        formed by crossing the ``frame_axis`` with the ``align_axis``. The
        exception is if the axes are parallel with opposite directions, in which
        case the rotation vector is chosen using the rules in the following
        table with the vectors expressed in the given frame:

    .. raw:: html

    Explanation
    ===========

    A pin joint is defined such that the joint rotation axis is fixed in both
    the child and parent and the location of the joint is relative to the mass
    center of each body. The child rotates an angle, θ, from the parent about
    the rotation axis and has a simple angular speed, ω, relative to the
    parent. The direction cosine matrix between the child interframe and
    parent interframe is formed using a simple rotation about the joint axis.

    Examples
    =========

    A single pin joint is created from two bodies and has the following basic
    attributes:

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import RigidBody, PinJoint
    >>> parent = RigidBody('P')
    >>> parent
    P
    >>> child = RigidBody('C')
    >>> child
    C
    >>> joint = PinJoint('PC', parent, child)
    >>> joint
    PinJoint: PC  parent: P  child: C
    >>> joint.name
    'PC'
    >>> joint.parent
    P
    >>> joint.child
    C
    >>> joint.parent_point
    P_masscenter
    >>> joint.child_point
    C_masscenter
    >>> joint.parent_axis
    P_frame.x
    >>> joint.child_axis
    C_frame.x
    >>> joint.coordinates
    Matrix([[q_PC(t)]])
    >>> joint.speeds
    Matrix([[u_PC(t)]])
    >>> child.frame.ang_vel_in(parent.frame)
    u_PC(t)*P_frame.x
    >>> child.frame.dcm(parent.frame)
    Matrix([
    [1,             0,            0],
    [0,  cos(q_PC(t)), sin(q_PC(t))],
    [0, -sin(q_PC(t)), cos(q_PC(t))]])
    >>> joint.child_point.pos_from(joint.parent_point)
    0

    To further demonstrate the use of the pin joint, the kinematics of simple
    double pendulum that rotates about the Z axis of each connected body can be
    created as follows.

    >>> from sympy import symbols, trigsimp
    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import RigidBody, PinJoint
    >>> l1, l2 = symbols('l1 l2')

    First create bodies to represent the fixed ceiling and one to represent
    each pendulum bob.

    >>> ceiling = RigidBody('C')
    >>> upper_bob = RigidBody('U')
    >>> lower_bob = RigidBody('L')

    The first joint will connect the upper bob to the ceiling by a distance of
    ``l1`` and the joint axis will be about the Z axis for each body.

    >>> ceiling_joint = PinJoint('P1', ceiling, upper_bob,
    ... child_point=-l1*upper_bob.frame.x,
    ... joint_axis=ceiling.frame.z)

    The second joint will connect the lower bob to the upper bob by a distance
    of ``l2`` and the joint axis will also be about the Z axis for each body.

    >>> pendulum_joint = PinJoint('P2', upper_bob, lower_bob,
    ... child_point=-l2*lower_bob.frame.x,
    ... joint_axis=upper_bob.frame.z)

    Once the joints are established the kinematics of the connected bodies can
    be accessed. First the direction cosine matrices of pendulum link relative
    to the ceiling are found:

    >>> upper_bob.frame.dcm(ceiling.frame)
    Matrix([
    [ cos(q_P1(t)), sin(q_P1(t)), 0],
    [-sin(q_P1(t)), cos(q_P1(t)), 0],
    [            0,            0, 1]])
    >>> trigsimp(lower_bob.frame.dcm(ceiling.frame))
    Matrix([
    [ cos(q_P1(t) + q_P2(t)), sin(q_P1(t) + q_P2(t)), 0],
    [-sin(q_P1(t) + q_P2(t)), cos(q_P1(t) + q_P2(t)), 0],
    [                      0,                      0, 1]])

    The position of the lower bob's masscenter is found with:

    >>> lower_bob.masscenter.pos_from(ceiling.masscenter)
    l1*U_frame.x + l2*L_frame.x

    The angular velocities of the two pendulum links can be computed with
    respect to the ceiling.

    >>> upper_bob.frame.ang_vel_in(ceiling.frame)
    u_P1(t)*C_frame.z
    >>> lower_bob.frame.ang_vel_in(ceiling.frame)
    u_P1(t)*C_frame.z + u_P2(t)*U_frame.z

    And finally, the linear velocities of the two pendulum bobs can be computed
    with respect to the ceiling.

    >>> upper_bob.masscenter.vel(ceiling.frame)
    l1*u_P1(t)*U_frame.y
    >>> lower_bob.masscenter.vel(ceiling.frame)
    l1*u_P1(t)*U_frame.y + l2*(u_P1(t) + u_P2(t))*L_frame.y

    Explanation
    ===========

    It is defined such that the child body translates with respect to the parent
    body along the body-fixed joint axis. The location of the joint is defined
    by two points, one in each body, which coincide when the generalized
    coordinate is zero. The direction cosine matrix between the
    parent_interframe and child_interframe is the identity matrix. Therefore,
    the direction cosine matrix between the parent and child frames is fully
    defined by the definition of the intermediate frames. The page on the joints
    framework gives a more detailed explanation of the intermediate frames.

    Examples
    =========

    A single prismatic joint is created from two bodies and has the following
    basic attributes:

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import RigidBody, PrismaticJoint
    >>> parent = RigidBody('P')
    >>> parent
    P
    >>> child = RigidBody('C')
    >>> child
    C
    >>> joint = PrismaticJoint('PC', parent, child)
    >>> joint
    PrismaticJoint: PC  parent: P  child: C
    >>> joint.name
    'PC'
    >>> joint.parent
    P
    >>> joint.child
    C
    >>> joint.parent_point
    P_masscenter
    >>> joint.child_point
    C_masscenter
    >>> joint.parent_axis
    P_frame.x
    >>> joint.child_axis
    C_frame.x
    >>> joint.coordinates
    Matrix([[q_PC(t)]])
    >>> joint.speeds
    Matrix([[u_PC(t)]])
    >>> child.frame.ang_vel_in(parent.frame)
    0
    >>> child.frame.dcm(parent.frame)
    Matrix([
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]])
    >>> joint.child_point.pos_from(joint.parent_point)
    q_PC(t)*P_frame.x

    To further demonstrate the use of the prismatic joint, the kinematics of two
    masses sliding, one moving relative to a fixed body and the other relative
    to the moving body. about the X axis of each connected body can be created
    as follows.

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import PrismaticJoint, RigidBody

    First create bodies to represent the fixed ceiling and one to represent
    a particle.

    >>> wall = RigidBody('W')
    >>> Part1 = RigidBody('P1')
    >>> Part2 = RigidBody('P2')

    The first joint will connect the particle to the ceiling and the
    joint axis will be about the X axis for each body.

    >>> J1 = PrismaticJoint('J1', wall, Part1)

    The second joint will connect the second particle to the first particle
    and the joint axis will also be about the X axis for each body.

    >>> J2 = PrismaticJoint('J2', Part1, Part2)

    Once the joint is established the kinematics of the connected bodies can
    be accessed. First the direction cosine matrices of Part relative
    to the ceiling are found:

    >>> Part1.frame.dcm(wall.frame)
    Matrix([
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]])

    >>> Part2.frame.dcm(wall.frame)
    Matrix([
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]])

    The position of the particles' masscenter is found with:

    >>> Part1.masscenter.pos_from(wall.masscenter)
    q_J1(t)*W_frame.x

    >>> Part2.masscenter.pos_from(wall.masscenter)
    q_J1(t)*W_frame.x + q_J2(t)*P1_frame.x

    The angular velocities of the two particle links can be computed with
    respect to the ceiling.

    >>> Part1.frame.ang_vel_in(wall.frame)
    0

    >>> Part2.frame.ang_vel_in(wall.frame)
    0

    And finally, the linear velocities of the two particles can be computed
    with respect to the ceiling.

    >>> Part1.masscenter.vel(wall.frame)
    u_J1(t)*W_frame.x

    >>> Part2.masscenter.vel(wall.frame)
    u_J1(t)*W_frame.x + Derivative(q_J2(t), t)*P1_frame.x

    .. image:: CylindricalJoint.svg
        :align: center

    Explanation
    ===========

    A cylindrical joint is defined such that the child body both rotates about
    and translates along the body-fixed joint axis with respect to the parent
    body. The joint axis is both the rotation axis and translation axis. The
    location of the joint is defined by two points, one in each body, which
    coincide when the generalized coordinate corresponding to the translation is
    zero. The direction cosine matrix between the child interframe and parent
    interframe is formed using a simple rotation about the joint axis. The page
    on the joints framework gives a more detailed explanation of the
    intermediate frames.

    >>> child.frame.dcm(parent.frame)
    Matrix([
    [1,              0,             0],
    [0,  cos(q0_PC(t)), sin(q0_PC(t))],
    [0, -sin(q0_PC(t)), cos(q0_PC(t))]])
    >>> joint.child_point.pos_from(joint.parent_point)
    q1_PC(t)*P_frame.x
    >>> child.masscenter.vel(parent.frame)
    u1_PC(t)*P_frame.x

    To further demonstrate the use of the cylindrical joint, the kinematics of
    two cylindrical joints perpendicular to each other can be created as follows.

    >>> from sympy import symbols
    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import RigidBody, CylindricalJoint
    >>> r, l, w = symbols('r l w')

    First create bodies to represent the fixed floor with a fixed pole on it.
    The second body represents a freely moving tube around that pole. The third
    body represents a solid flag freely translating along and rotating around
    the Y axis of the tube.

    >>> floor = RigidBody('floor')
    >>> tube = RigidBody('tube')
    >>> flag = RigidBody('flag')

    The first joint will connect the first tube to the floor with it translating
    along and rotating around the Z axis of both bodies.

    >>> floor_joint = CylindricalJoint('C1', floor, tube, joint_axis=floor.z)

    The second joint will connect the tube perpendicular to the flag along the Y
    axis of both the tube and the flag, with the joint located at a distance
    ``r`` from the tube's center of mass and a combination of the distances
    ``l`` and ``w`` from the flag's center of mass.

    >>> flag_joint = CylindricalJoint('C2', tube, flag,
    ...                               parent_point=r * tube.y,
    ...                               child_point=-w * flag.y + l * flag.z,
    ...                               joint_axis=tube.y)

    Once the joints are established the kinematics of the connected bodies can
    be accessed. First the direction cosine matrices of both the body and the
    flag relative to the floor are found:

    >>> tube.frame.dcm(floor.frame)
    Matrix([
    [ cos(q0_C1(t)), sin(q0_C1(t)), 0],
    [-sin(q0_C1(t)), cos(q0_C1(t)), 0],
    [             0,             0, 1]])
    >>> flag.frame.dcm(floor.frame)
    Matrix([
    [cos(q0_C1(t))*cos(q0_C2(t)), sin(q0_C1(t))*cos(q0_C2(t)), -sin(q0_C2(t))],
    [             -sin(q0_C1(t)),               cos(q0_C1(t)),              0],
    [sin(q0_C2(t))*cos(q0_C1(t)), sin(q0_C1(t))*sin(q0_C2(t)),  cos(q0_C2(t))]])

    The position of the flag's center of mass is found with:

    >>> flag.masscenter.pos_from(floor.masscenter)
    q1_C1(t)*floor_frame.z + (r + q1_C2(t))*tube_frame.y + w*flag_frame.y - l*flag_frame.z

    The angular velocities of the two tubes can be computed with respect to the
    floor.

    >>> tube.frame.ang_vel_in(floor.frame)
    u0_C1(t)*floor_frame.z
    >>> flag.frame.ang_vel_in(floor.frame)
    u0_C1(t)*floor_frame.z + u0_C2(t)*tube_frame.y

    Finally, the linear velocities of the two tube centers of mass can be
    computed with respect to the floor, while expressed in the tube's frame.

    >>> tube.masscenter.vel(floor.frame).to_matrix(tube.frame)
    Matrix([
    [       0],
    [       0],
    [u1_C1(t)]])
    >>> flag.masscenter.vel(floor.frame).to_matrix(tube.frame).simplify()
    Matrix([
    [-l*u0_C2(t)*cos(q0_C2(t)) - r*u0_C1(t) - w*u0_C1(t) - q1_C2(t)*u0_C1(t)],
    [                    -l*u0_C1(t)*sin(q0_C2(t)) + Derivative(q1_C2(t), t)],
    [                                    l*u0_C2(t)*sin(q0_C2(t)) + u1_C1(t)]])

    """Planar Joint.

    .. raw:: html
        :file: ../../../doc/src/modules/physics/mechanics/api/PlanarJoint.svg

    Explanation
    ===========

    A planar joint is defined such that the child body translates over a fixed
    plane of the parent body as well as rotate about the rotation axis, which
    is perpendicular to that plane. The origin of this plane is the
    ``parent_point`` and the plane is spanned by two nonparallel planar vectors.
    The location of the ``child_point`` is based on the planar vectors
    ($\\vec{v}_1$, $\\vec{v}_2$) and generalized coordinates ($q_1$, $q_2$),
    i.e. $\\vec{r} = q_1 \\hat{v}_1 + q_2 \\hat{v}_2$. The direction cosine
    matrix between the ``child_interframe`` and ``parent_interframe`` is formed
    using a simple rotation ($q_0$) about the rotation axis.

    In order to simplify the definition of the ``PlanarJoint``, the
    ``rotation_axis`` and ``planar_vectors`` are set to be the unit vectors of
    the ``parent_interframe`` according to the table below. This ensures that
    you can only define these vectors by creating a separate frame and supplying
    that as the interframe. If you however would only like to supply the normals
    of the plane with respect to the parent and child bodies, then you can also
    supply those to the ``parent_interframe`` and ``child_interframe``
    arguments. An example of both of these cases is in the examples section
    below and the page on the joints framework provides a more detailed
    explanation of the intermediate frames.

    Examples
    =========

    A single planar joint is created between two bodies and has the following
    basic attributes:

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import RigidBody, PlanarJoint
    >>> parent = RigidBody('P')
    >>> parent
    P
    >>> child = RigidBody('C')
    >>> child
    C
    >>> joint = PlanarJoint('PC', parent, child)
    >>> joint
    PlanarJoint: PC  parent: P  child: C
    >>> joint.name
    'PC'
    >>> joint.parent

    >>> joint.child_point
    C_masscenter
    >>> joint.rotation_axis
    P_frame.x
    >>> joint.planar_vectors
    [P_frame.y, P_frame.z]
    >>> joint.rotation_coordinate
    q0_PC(t)
    >>> joint.planar_coordinates
    Matrix([
    [q1_PC(t)],
    [q2_PC(t)]])
    >>> joint.coordinates
    Matrix([
    [q0_PC(t)],
    [q1_PC(t)],
    [q2_PC(t)]])
    >>> joint.rotation_speed
    u0_PC(t)
    >>> joint.planar_speeds
    Matrix([
    [u1_PC(t)],
    [u2_PC(t)]])
    >>> joint.speeds
    Matrix([
    [u0_PC(t)],
    [u1_PC(t)],
    [u2_PC(t)]])
    >>> child.frame.ang_vel_in(parent.frame)
    u0_PC(t)*P_frame.x
    >>> child.frame.dcm(parent.frame)
    Matrix([
    [1,              0,             0],
    [0,  cos(q0_PC(t)), sin(q0_PC(t))],
    [0, -sin(q0_PC(t)), cos(q0_PC(t))]])
    >>> joint.child_point.pos_from(joint.parent_point)
    q1_PC(t)*P_frame.y + q2_PC(t)*P_frame.z
    >>> child.masscenter.vel(parent.frame)
    u1_PC(t)*P_frame.y + u2_PC(t)*P_frame.z

    To further demonstrate the use of the planar joint, the kinematics of a
    block sliding on a slope, can be created as follows.

    >>> from sympy import symbols
    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import PlanarJoint, RigidBody, ReferenceFrame
    >>> a, d, h = symbols('a d h')

    First create bodies to represent the slope and the block.

    >>> ground = RigidBody('G')
    >>> block = RigidBody('B')

    To define the slope you can either define the plane by specifying the
    ``planar_vectors`` or/and the ``rotation_axis``. However it is advisable to
    create a rotated intermediate frame, so that the ``parent_vectors`` and
    ``rotation_axis`` will be the unit vectors of this intermediate frame.

    >>> slope = ReferenceFrame('A')
    >>> slope.orient_axis(ground.frame, ground.y, a)

    The planar joint can be created using these bodies and intermediate frame.
    We can specify the origin of the slope to be ``d`` above the slope's center
    of mass and the block's center of mass to be a distance ``h`` above the
    slope's surface. Note that we can specify the normal of the plane using the
    rotation axis argument.

    >>> joint = PlanarJoint('PC', ground, block, parent_point=d * ground.x,
    ...                     child_point=-h * block.x, parent_interframe=slope)

    Once the joint is established the kinematics of the bodies can be accessed.
    First the ``rotation_axis``, which is normal to the plane and the
    ``plane_vectors``, can be found.

    >>> joint.rotation_axis
    A.x
    >>> joint.planar_vectors
    [A.y, A.z]

    The direction cosine matrix of the block with respect to the ground can be
    found with:

    >>> block.frame.dcm(ground.frame)
    Matrix([
    [              cos(a),              0,              -sin(a)],
    [sin(a)*sin(q0_PC(t)),  cos(q0_PC(t)), sin(q0_PC(t))*cos(a)],
    [sin(a)*cos(q0_PC(t)), -sin(q0_PC(t)), cos(a)*cos(q0_PC(t))]])

    The angular velocity of the block can be computed with respect to the
    ground.

    >>> block.frame.ang_vel_in(ground.frame)
    u0_PC(t)*A.x

    The position of the block's center of mass can be found with:

    >>> block.masscenter.pos_from(ground.masscenter)
    d*G_frame.x + h*B_frame.x + q1_PC(t)*A.y + q2_PC(t)*A.z

    Finally, the linear velocity of the block's center of mass can be
    computed with respect to the ground.

    >>> block.masscenter.vel(ground.frame)
    u1_PC(t)*A.y + u2_PC(t)*A.z

    In some cases it could be your preference to only define the normals of the
    plane with respect to both bodies. This can most easily be done by supplying
    vectors to the ``interframe`` arguments. What will happen in this case is
    that an interframe will be created with its ``x`` axis aligned with the
    provided vector. For a further explanation of how this is done see the notes
    of the ``Joint`` class. In the code below, the above example (with the block
    on the slope) is recreated by supplying vectors to the interframe arguments.
    Note that the previously described option is however more computationally
    efficient, because the algorithm now has to compute the rotation angle
    between the provided vector and the 'x' axis.

    >>> from sympy import symbols, cos, sin
    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import PlanarJoint, RigidBody
    >>> a, d, h = symbols('a d h')
    >>> ground = RigidBody('G')
    >>> block = RigidBody('B')
    >>> joint = PlanarJoint(
    ...     'PC', ground, block, parent_point=d * ground.x,
    ...     child_point=-h * block.x, child_interframe=block.x,
    ...     parent_interframe=cos(a) * ground.x + sin(a) * ground.z)
    >>> block.frame.dcm(ground.frame).simplify()
    Matrix([
    [               cos(a),              0,               sin(a)],
    [-sin(a)*sin(q0_PC(t)),  cos(q0_PC(t)), sin(q0_PC(t))*cos(a)],
    [-sin(a)*cos(q0_PC(t)), -sin(q0_PC(t)), cos(a)*cos(q0_PC(t))]])

class SphericalJoint(Joint):
    '''Spherical (Ball-and-Socket) Joint.

    .. image:: SphericalJoint.svg
        :align: center
        :width: 600

    Explanation
    ===========

    A spherical joint is defined such that the child body is free to rotate in
    any direction, without allowing a translation of the ``child_point``. As can
    also be seen in the image, the ``parent_point`` and ``child_point`` are
    fixed on top of each other, i.e. the ``joint_point``. This rotation is
    defined using the :func:`parent_interframe.orient(child_interframe,
    rot_type, amounts, rot_order)
    <sympy.physics.vector.frame.ReferenceFrame.orient>` method. The default
    rotation consists of three relative rotations, i.e. body-fixed rotations.
    Based on the direction cosine matrix following from these rotations, the
    angular velocity is computed based on the generalized coordinates and
    generalized speeds.

    Parameters

        value is the parent\'s own frame.
    child_interframe : ReferenceFrame, optional
        Intermediate frame of the child body with respect to which the joint
        transformation is formulated. If a Vector is provided then an interframe

          vectors

        The default method is ``\'Body\'``.
    amounts :
        Expressions defining the rotation angles or direction cosine matrix.
        These must match the ``rot_type``. See examples below for details. The
        input types are:

        - ``\'Body\'``: 3-tuple of expressions, symbols, or functions
        - ``\'Space\'``: 3-tuple of expressions, symbols, or functions

        The default amounts are the given ``coordinates``.
    rot_order : str or int, optional
        If applicable, the order of the successive of rotations. The string
        ``\'123\'`` and integer ``123`` are equivalent, for example. Required for

    A single spherical joint is created from two bodies and has the following
    basic attributes:

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import RigidBody, SphericalJoint

    >>> parent
    P
    >>> child = RigidBody(\'C\')

    Matrix([
    [ u0_PC(t)*cos(q1_PC(t))*cos(q2_PC(t)) + u1_PC(t)*sin(q2_PC(t))],
    [-u0_PC(t)*sin(q2_PC(t))*cos(q1_PC(t)) + u1_PC(t)*cos(q2_PC(t))],
    [                             u0_PC(t)*sin(q1_PC(t)) + u2_PC(t)]])
    >>> child.frame.x.to_matrix(parent.frame)

    [sin(q0_PC(t))*sin(q1_PC(t))*cos(q2_PC(t)) + sin(q2_PC(t))*cos(q0_PC(t))],

    >>> joint.child_point.pos_from(joint.parent_point)
    0

    To further demonstrate the use of the spherical joint, the kinematics of a
    spherical joint with a ZXZ rotation can be created as follows.

    >>> from sympy import symbols
    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import RigidBody, SphericalJoint
    >>> l1 = symbols(\'l1\')

    First create bodies to represent the fixed floor and a pendulum bob.

    >>> floor = RigidBody(\'F\')
    >>> bob = RigidBody(\'B\')

    The joint will connect the bob to the floor, with the joint located at a
    distance of ``l1`` from the child\'s center of mass and the rotation set to a
    body-fixed ZXZ rotation.

    >>> joint = SphericalJoint(\'S\', floor, bob, child_point=l1 * bob.y,
    ...                        rot_type=\'body\', rot_order=\'ZXZ\')

    Now that the joint is established, the kinematics of the connected body can
    be accessed.

    The position of the bob\'s masscenter is found with:

    >>> bob.masscenter.pos_from(floor.masscenter)
    - l1*B_frame.y

    The angular velocities of the pendulum link can be computed with respect to
    the floor.

    >>> bob.frame.ang_vel_in(floor.frame).to_matrix(
    ...     floor.frame).simplify()
    Matrix([
    [u1_S(t)*cos(q0_S(t)) + u2_S(t)*sin(q0_S(t))*sin(q1_S(t))],
    [u1_S(t)*sin(q0_S(t)) - u2_S(t)*sin(q1_S(t))*cos(q0_S(t))],
    [                          u0_S(t) + u2_S(t)*cos(q1_S(t))]])

    Finally, the linear velocity of the bob\'s center of mass can be computed.

    >>> bob.masscenter.vel(floor.frame).to_matrix(bob.frame)
    Matrix([
    [                           l1*(u0_S(t)*cos(q1_S(t)) + u2_S(t))],

    """Weld Joint.

    .. raw:: html

    Explanation
    ===========

    A weld joint is defined such that there is no relative motion between the

    frame (``parent_interframe`` and ``child_interframe``) is the identity
    matrix and the attachment points (``parent_point`` and ``child_point``) are
    coincident. The page on the joints framework gives a more detailed

    To further demonstrate the use of the weld joint, two relatively-fixed
    bodies rotated by a quarter turn about the Y axis can be created as follows:

    >>> from sympy import symbols, pi
    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import ReferenceFrame, RigidBody, WeldJoint
    >>> l1, l2 = symbols('l1 l2')

    First create the bodies to represent the parent and rotated child body.

    >>> parent = RigidBody('P')
    >>> child = RigidBody('C')

    Next the intermediate frame specifying the fixed rotation with respect to
    the parent can be created.

    >>> rotated_frame = ReferenceFrame('Pr')
    >>> rotated_frame.orient_axis(parent.frame, parent.y, pi / 2)

    The weld between the parent body and child body is located at a distance
    ``l1`` from the parent's center of mass in the X direction and ``l2`` from
    the child's center of mass in the child's negative X direction.

    >>> weld = WeldJoint('weld', parent, child, parent_point=l1 * parent.x,
    ...                  child_point=-l2 * child.x,
    ...                  parent_interframe=rotated_frame)

    Now that the joint has been established, the kinematics of the bodies can be
    accessed. The direction cosine matrix of the child body with respect to the
    parent can be found:

    >>> child.frame.dcm(parent.frame)
    Matrix([
    [0, 0, -1],
    [0, 1,  0],
    [1, 0,  0]])

    As can also been seen from the direction cosine matrix, the parent X axis is
    aligned with the child's Z axis:
    >>> parent.x == child.z
    True

    The position of the child's center of mass with respect to the parent's
    center of mass can be found with:

    >>> child.masscenter.pos_from(parent.masscenter)
    l1*P_frame.x + l2*C_frame.x

    The angular velocity of the child with respect to the parent is 0 as one
    would expect.

    >>> child.frame.ang_vel_in(parent.frame)
    0

class Body(RigidBody, Particle):
    """
    Body is a common representation of either a RigidBody or a Particle SymPy
    object depending on what is passed in during initialization. If a mass is
    passed in and central_inertia is left as None, the Particle object is
    created. Otherwise a RigidBody object will be created.

    .. deprecated:: 1.13
        The Body class is deprecated. Its functionality is captured by
        :class:`~.RigidBody` and :class:`~.Particle`.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The attributes that Body possesses will be the same as a Particle instance
    or a Rigid Body instance depending on which was created. Additional
    attributes are listed below.

    Attributes
    ==========

    name : string
        The body's name
    masscenter : Point
        The point which represents the center of mass of the rigid body
    frame : ReferenceFrame
        The reference frame which the body is fixed in
    mass : Sympifyable
        The body's mass
    inertia : (Dyadic, Point)
        The body's inertia around its center of mass. This attribute is specific
        to the rigid body form of Body and is left undefined for the Particle
        form
    loads : iterable
        This list contains information on the different loads acting on the
        Body. Forces are listed as a (point, vector) tuple and torques are
        listed as (reference frame, vector) tuples.

    Parameters
    ==========

    name : String
        Defines the name of the body. It is used as the base for defining
        body specific properties.
    masscenter : Point, optional
        A point that represents the center of mass of the body or particle.
        If no point is given, a point is generated.
    mass : Sympifyable, optional
        A Sympifyable object which represents the mass of the body. If no
        mass is passed, one is generated.
    frame : ReferenceFrame, optional
        The ReferenceFrame that represents the reference frame of the body.
        If no frame is given, a frame is generated.
    central_inertia : Dyadic, optional
        Central inertia dyadic of the body. If none is passed while creating
        RigidBody, a default inertia is generated.

    Examples
    ========

    As Body has been deprecated, the following examples are for illustrative
    purposes only. The functionality of Body is fully captured by
    :class:`~.RigidBody` and :class:`~.Particle`. To ignore the deprecation
    warning we can use the ignore_warnings context manager.

        >>> from sympy.utilities.exceptions import ignore_warnings

    Default behaviour. This results in the creation of a RigidBody object for
    which the mass, mass center, frame and inertia attributes are given default
    values. ::

        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Body
        >>> with ignore_warnings(DeprecationWarning):
        ...     body = Body('name_of_body')

    This next example demonstrates the code required to specify all of the
    values of the Body object. Note this will also create a RigidBody version of
    the Body object. ::

        >>> from sympy import Symbol
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import ReferenceFrame, Point, inertia
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Body
        >>> mass = Symbol('mass')
        >>> masscenter = Point('masscenter')
        >>> frame = ReferenceFrame('frame')
        >>> ixx = Symbol('ixx')
        >>> body_inertia = inertia(frame, ixx, 0, 0)
        >>> with ignore_warnings(DeprecationWarning):
        ...     body = Body('name_of_body', masscenter, mass, frame, body_inertia)

    The minimal code required to create a Particle version of the Body object
    involves simply passing in a name and a mass. ::

        >>> from sympy import Symbol
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Body
        >>> mass = Symbol('mass')
        >>> with ignore_warnings(DeprecationWarning):
        ...     body = Body('name_of_body', mass=mass)

    The Particle version of the Body object can also receive a masscenter point
    and a reference frame, just not an inertia.

        frame : ReferenceFrame or Body

            The force to be applied.
        point: Point, optional

        We can also remove some part of force from any point on the body by

        >>> B1.apply_force(spring_force, point=P1, reaction_body=B2, reaction_point=P2)

        If a new force is applied to a body on a point which already has some

        force on that point.

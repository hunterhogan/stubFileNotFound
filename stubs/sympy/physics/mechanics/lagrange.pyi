class LagrangesMethod(_Methods):
    '''Lagrange\'s method object.

    Explanation
    ===========

    This object generates the equations of motion in a two step procedure. The
    first step involves the initialization of LagrangesMethod by supplying the
    Lagrangian and the generalized coordinates, at the bare minimum. If there
    are any constraint equations, they can be supplied as keyword arguments.
    The Lagrange multipliers are automatically generated and are equal in
    number to the constraint equations. Similarly any non-conservative forces
    can be supplied in an iterable (as described below and also shown in the
    example) along with a ReferenceFrame. This is also discussed further in the
    __init__ method.

    Attributes
    ==========

    q, u : Matrix
        Matrices of the generalized coordinates and speeds
    loads : iterable
        Iterable of (Point, vector) or (ReferenceFrame, vector) tuples
        describing the forces on the system.
    bodies : iterable
        Iterable containing the rigid bodies and particles of the system.
    mass_matrix : Matrix
        The system\'s mass matrix
    forcing : Matrix
        The system\'s forcing vector
    mass_matrix_full : Matrix
        The "mass matrix" for the qdot\'s, qdoubledot\'s, and the
        lagrange multipliers (lam)
    forcing_full : Matrix
        The forcing vector for the qdot\'s, qdoubledot\'s and
        lagrange multipliers (lam)

    Examples
    ========

    This is a simple example for a one degree of freedom translational
    spring-mass-damper.

    In this example, we first need to do the kinematics.
    This involves creating generalized coordinates and their derivatives.
    Then we create a point and set its velocity in a frame.

        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import LagrangesMethod, Lagrangian
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import ReferenceFrame, Particle, Point
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import dynamicsymbols
        >>> from sympy import symbols
        >>> q = dynamicsymbols(\'q\')
        >>> qd = dynamicsymbols(\'q\', 1)
        >>> m, k, b = symbols(\'m k b\')
        >>> N = ReferenceFrame(\'N\')
        >>> P = Point(\'P\')
        >>> P.set_vel(N, qd * N.x)

    We need to then prepare the information as required by LagrangesMethod to
    generate equations of motion.
    First we create the Particle, which has a point attached to it.
    Following this the lagrangian is created from the kinetic and potential
    energies.
    Then, an iterable of nonconservative forces/torques must be constructed,
    where each item is a (Point, Vector) or (ReferenceFrame, Vector) tuple,
    with the Vectors representing the nonconservative forces or torques.

        >>> Pa = Particle(\'Pa\', P, m)
        >>> Pa.potential_energy = k * q**2 / 2.0
        >>> L = Lagrangian(N, Pa)
        >>> fl = [(P, -b * qd * N.x)]

    Finally we can generate the equations of motion.
    First we create the LagrangesMethod object. To do this one must supply
    the Lagrangian, and the generalized coordinates. The constraint equations,
    the forcelist, and the inertial frame may also be provided, if relevant.
    Next we generate Lagrange\'s equations of motion, such that:
    Lagrange\'s equations of motion = 0.
    We have the equations of motion at this point.

        >>> l = LagrangesMethod(L, [q], forcelist = fl, frame = N)
        >>> print(l.form_lagranges_equations())
        Matrix([[b*Derivative(q(t), t) + 1.0*k*q(t) + m*Derivative(q(t), (t, 2))]])

    We can also solve for the states using the \'rhs\' method.

        >>> print(l.rhs())
        Matrix([[Derivative(q(t), t)], [(-b*Derivative(q(t), t) - 1.0*k*q(t))/m]])

        q_ind, qd_ind : array_like, optional

            form ``A*x=b`` in the linearization process. If a string is
            supplied, it should be a valid method that can be used with the
            :meth:`sympy.matrices.matrixbase.MatrixBase.solve`. If a callable is
            supplied, it should have the format ``x = f(A, b)``, where it
            solves the equations and returns the solution. The default is
            ``'LU'`` which corresponds to SymPy's ``A.LUsolve(b)``.

        linear_solver : str, callable

        **kwargs
            Extra keyword arguments are passed to

        Explanation
        ===========

        If kwarg A_and_B is False (default), returns M, A, B, r for the
        linearized form, M*[q', u']^T = A*[q_ind, u_ind]^T + B*r.

        If kwarg A_and_B is True, returns A, B, r for the linearized form
        dx = A*x + B*r, where x = [q_ind, u_ind]^T. Note that this is
        computationally intensive if there are many symbolic parameters. For
        this reason, it may be more desirable to use the default A_and_B=False,
        returning M, A, and B. Values may then be substituted in to these
        matrices, and the state space form found as
        A = P.T*M.inv()*A, B = P.T*M.inv()*B, where P = Linearizer.perm_mat.

        In both cases, r is found as all dynamicsymbols in the equations of
        motion that are not part of q, u, q', or u'. They are sorted in
        canonical form.

        The operating points may be also entered using the ``op_point`` kwarg.
        This takes a dictionary of {symbol: value}, or a an iterable of such
        dictionaries. The values may be numeric or symbolic. The more values
        you can specify beforehand, the faster this computation will run.

    Parameters
    ==========

    values : list, str
        The qubit values as a list of ints ([0,0,0,1,1,]) or a string ('011').

    Examples
    ========

    Create a qubit in a couple of different ways and look at their attributes:

        >>> from sympy.physics.quantum.qubit import Qubit
        >>> Qubit(0,0,0)
        |000>
        >>> q = Qubit('0101')
        >>> q
        |0101>

        >>> q.nqubits
        4
        >>> len(q)
        4
        >>> q.dimension
        4
        >>> q.qubit_values
        (0, 1, 0, 1)

    We can flip the value of an individual qubit:

        >>> q.flip(1)
        |0111>

    We can take the dagger of a Qubit to get a bra:

        >>> from sympy.physics.quantum.dagger import Dagger
        >>> Dagger(q)
        <0101|
        >>> type(Dagger(q))
        <class 'sympy.physics.quantum.qubit.QubitBra'>

    Inner products work as expected:

        >>> ip = Dagger(q)*q
        >>> ip
        <0101|0101>
        >>> ip.doit()
        1

class IntQubit(IntQubitState, Qubit):

    The differences between this class and ``Qubit`` are:

    * The form of the constructor.
    * The qubit values are printed as their corresponding integer, rather
      than the raw qubit values. The internal storage format of the qubit
      values in the same as ``Qubit``.

    Parameters
    ==========

    values : int, tuple
        If a single argument, the integer we want to represent in the qubit
        values. This integer will be represented using the fewest possible
        number of qubits.
        If a pair of integers and the second value is more than one, the first
        integer gives the integer to represent in binary form and the second
        integer gives the number of qubits to use.
        List of zeros and ones is also accepted to generate qubit by bit pattern.

    nqubits : int
        The integer that represents the number of qubits.
        This number should be passed with keyword ``nqubits=N``.
        You can use this in order to avoid ambiguity of Qubit-style tuple of bits.
        Please see the example below for more details.

    Examples
    ========

    Create a qubit for the integer 5:

        >>> from sympy.physics.quantum.qubit import IntQubit
        >>> from sympy.physics.quantum.qubit import Qubit
        >>> q = IntQubit(5)
        >>> q
        |5>

    We can also create an ``IntQubit`` by passing a ``Qubit`` instance.

        >>> q = IntQubit(Qubit('101'))
        >>> q
        |5>
        >>> q.as_int()
        5
        >>> q.nqubits
        3
        >>> q.qubit_values
        (1, 0, 1)

    We can go back to the regular qubit form.

        >>> Qubit(q)
        |101>

    Please note that ``IntQubit`` also accepts a ``Qubit``-style list of bits.
    So, the code below yields qubits 3, not a single bit ``1``.

        >>> IntQubit(1, 1)
        |3>

    To avoid ambiguity, use ``nqubits`` parameter.
    Use of this keyword is recommended especially when you provide the values by variables.

        >>> IntQubit(1, nqubits=1)
        |1>
        >>> a = 1
        >>> IntQubit(a, nqubits=1)
        |1>

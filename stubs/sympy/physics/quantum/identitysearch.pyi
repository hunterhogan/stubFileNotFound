def generate_gate_rules(gate_seq, return_as_muls: bool = False):
    """Returns a set of gate rules.  Each gate rules is represented
    as a 2-tuple of tuples or Muls.  An empty tuple represents an arbitrary
    scalar value.

    This function uses the four operations (LL, LR, RL, RR)
    to generate the gate rules.

    A gate rule is an expression such as ABC = D or AB = CD, where
    A, B, C, and D are gates.  Each value on either side of the
    equal sign represents a circuit.  The four operations allow
    one to find a set of equivalent circuits from a gate identity.
    The letters denoting the operation tell the user what
    activities to perform on each expression.  The first letter
    indicates which side of the equal sign to focus on.  The
    second letter indicates which gate to focus on given the
    side.  Once this information is determined, the inverse
    of the gate is multiplied on both circuits to create a new
    gate rule.

    For example, given the identity, ABCD = 1, a LL operation
    means look at the left value and multiply both left sides by the
    inverse of the leftmost gate A.  If A is Hermitian, the inverse
    of A is still A.  The resulting new rule is BCD = A.

    The following is a summary of the four operations.  Assume
    that in the examples, all gates are Hermitian.

        LL : left circuit, left multiply
             ABCD = E -> AABCD = AE -> BCD = AE
        LR : left circuit, right multiply
             ABCD = E -> ABCDD = ED -> ABC = ED
        RL : right circuit, left multiply
             ABC = ED -> EABC = EED -> EABC = D
        RR : right circuit, right multiply
             AB = CD -> ABD = CDD -> ABD = C

    The number of gate rules generated is n*(n+1), where n
    is the number of gates in the sequence (unproven).

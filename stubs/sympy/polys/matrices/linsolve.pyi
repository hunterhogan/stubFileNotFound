    Examples
    ========

    Solve a linear system with a unique solution:

    >>> from sympy import symbols, Eq
    >>> from sympy.polys.matrices.linsolve import _linsolve
    >>> x, y = symbols('x, y')
    >>> eqs = [Eq(x + y, 1), Eq(x - y, 2)]
    >>> _linsolve(eqs, [x, y])
    {x: 3/2, y: -1/2}

    In the case of underdetermined systems the solution will be expressed in
    terms of the unknown symbols that are unconstrained:

    >>> _linsolve([Eq(x + y, 0)], [x, y])
    {x: -y, y: y}

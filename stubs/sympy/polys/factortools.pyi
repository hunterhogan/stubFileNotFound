    factors. For this purpose a parallel Hensel lifting procedure is used.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Uses Trager's algorithm. In particular this function is algorithm
    ``alg_factor`` from [Trager76]_.

    If `f` is a polynomial in `k(a)[x]` then its norm `g(x)` is a polynomial in
    `k[x]`. If `g(x)` is square-free and has irreducible factors `g_1(x)`,
    `g_2(x)`, `\\cdots` then the irreducible factors of `f` in `k(a)[x]` are
    given by `f_i(x) = \\gcd(f(x), g_i(x))` where the GCD is computed in
    `k(a)[x]`.

    The first step in Trager's algorithm is to find an integer shift `s` so
    that `f(x-sa)` has square-free norm. Then the norm is factorized in `k[x]`
    and the GCD of (shifted) `f` with each factor gives the shifted factors of
    `f`. At the end the shift is undone to recover the unshifted factors of `f`
    in `k(a)[x]`.

    The algorithm reduces the problem of factorization in `k(a)[x]` to
    factorization in `k[x]` with the main additional steps being to compute the
    norm (a resultant calculation in `k[x,y]`) and some polynomial GCDs in
    `k(a)[x]`.

    In practice in SymPy the base field `k` will be the rationals :ref:`QQ` and
    this function factorizes a polynomial with coefficients in an algebraic
    number field  like `\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})`.

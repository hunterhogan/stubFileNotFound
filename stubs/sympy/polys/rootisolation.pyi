    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import CRootOf, S
    >>> from sympy.abc import x
    >>> CRootOf.clear_cache()  # for doctest reproducibility
    >>> root = CRootOf(x**10 - 2*x + 3, 9)
    >>> i = root._get_interval(); i
    (3/64, 3/32) x (9/8, 75/64)

    The real part of the root lies within the range [0, 3/4] while
    the imaginary part lies within the range [9/8, 3/2]:

    >>> root.n(3)
    0.0766 + 1.14*I

    The width of the ranges in the x and y directions on the complex
    plane are:

    >>> i.dx, i.dy
    (3/64, 3/64)

    The center of the range is

    >>> i.center
    (9/128, 147/128)

    The northeast coordinate of the rectangle bounding the root in the
    complex plane is given by attribute b and the x and y components
    are accessed by bx and by:

    >>> i.b, i.bx, i.by
    ((3/32, 75/64), 3/32, 75/64)

    The southwest coordinate is similarly given by i.a

    >>> i.a, i.ax, i.ay
    ((3/64, 9/8), 3/64, 9/8)

    Although the interval prints to show only the real and imaginary
    range of the root, all the information of the underlying root
    is contained as properties of the interval.

    For example, an interval with a nonpositive imaginary range is
    considered to be the conjugate. Since the y values of y are in the
    range [0, 1/4] it is not the conjugate:

    >>> i.conj
    False

    The conjugate's interval is

    >>> ic = i.conjugate(); ic
    (3/64, 3/32) x (-75/64, -9/8)

        NOTE: the values printed still represent the x and y range
        in which the root -- conjugate, in this case -- is located,
        but the underlying a and b values of a root and its conjugate
        are the same:

        >>> assert i.a == ic.a and i.b == ic.b

        What changes are the reported coordinates of the bounding rectangle:

        >>> (i.ax, i.ay), (i.bx, i.by)
        ((3/64, 9/8), (3/32, 75/64))
        >>> (ic.ax, ic.ay), (ic.bx, ic.by)
        ((3/64, -75/64), (3/32, -9/8))

    The interval can be refined once:

    >>> i  # for reference, this is the current interval
    (3/64, 3/32) x (9/8, 75/64)

    >>> i.refine()
    (3/64, 3/32) x (9/8, 147/128)

    Several refinement steps can be taken:

    >>> i.refine_step(2)  # 2 steps
    (9/128, 3/32) x (9/8, 147/128)

    It is also possible to refine to a given tolerance:

    >>> tol = min(i.dx, i.dy)/2
    >>> i.refine_size(tol)
    (9/128, 21/256) x (9/8, 291/256)

    A disjoint interval is one whose bounding rectangle does not
    overlap with another. An interval, necessarily, is not disjoint with
    itself, but any interval is disjoint with a conjugate since the
    conjugate rectangle will always be in the lower half of the complex
    plane and the non-conjugate in the upper half:

    >>> i.is_disjoint(i), i.is_disjoint(i.conjugate())
    (False, True)

    The following interval j is not disjoint from i:

    >>> close = CRootOf(x**10 - 2*x + 300/S(101), 9)
    >>> j = close._get_interval(); j
    (75/1616, 75/808) x (225/202, 1875/1616)
    >>> i.is_disjoint(j)
    False

    The two can be made disjoint, however:

    >>> newi, newj = i.refine_disjoint(j)
    >>> newi
    (39/512, 159/2048) x (2325/2048, 4653/4096)
    >>> newj
    (3975/51712, 2025/25856) x (29325/25856, 117375/103424)

    Even though the real ranges overlap, the imaginary do not, so
    the roots have been resolved as distinct. Intervals are disjoint
    when either the real or imaginary component of the intervals is
    distinct. In the case above, the real components have not been
    resolved (so we do not know, yet, which root has the smaller real
    part) but the imaginary part of ``close`` is larger than ``root``:

    >>> close.n(3)
    0.0771 + 1.13*I
    >>> root.n(3)
    0.0766 + 1.14*I

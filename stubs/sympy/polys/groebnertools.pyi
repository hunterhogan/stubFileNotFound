def _buchberger(f, ring):

    Computes Groebner basis for a set of polynomials in `K[X]`.

    Given a set of multivariate polynomials `F`, finds another
    set `G`, such that Ideal `F = Ideal G` and `G` is a reduced
    Groebner basis.

    The resulting basis is unique and has monic generators if the
    ground domains is a field. Otherwise the result is non-unique
    but Groebner bases over e.g. integers can be computed (if the
    input polynomials are monic).

    Groebner bases can be used to choose specific generators for a
    polynomial ideal. Because these bases are unique you can check
    for ideal equality by comparing the Groebner bases.  To see if
    one polynomial lies in an ideal, divide by the elements in the
    base and see if the remainder vanishes.

    They can also be used to solve systems of polynomial equations
    as,  by choosing lexicographic ordering,  you can eliminate one
    variable at a time, provided that the ideal is zero-dimensional
    (finite number of solutions).

def _f5b(F, ring):
    '''
    Computes a reduced Groebner basis for the ideal generated by F.

    f5b is an implementation of the F5B algorithm by Yao Sun and
    Dingkang Wang. Similarly to Buchberger\'s algorithm, the algorithm
    proceeds by computing critical pairs, computing the S-polynomial,
    reducing it and adjoining the reduced S-polynomial if it is not 0.

    Unlike Buchberger\'s algorithm, each polynomial contains additional
    information, namely a signature and a number. The signature
    specifies the path of computation (i.e. from which polynomial in
    the original basis was it derived and how), the number says when
    the polynomial was added to the basis.  With this information it
    is (often) possible to decide if an S-polynomial will reduce to
    0 and can be discarded.

    Optimizations include: Reducing the generators before computing
    a Groebner basis, removing redundant critical pairs when a new
    polynomial enters the basis and sorting the critical pairs and
    the current basis.

    Once a Groebner basis has been found, it gets reduced.

"""Default glyphmap writer. Writes rows like:


picosvg/clipped/emoji_u270d_1f3fb.svg, bitmap/emoji_u270d_1f3fb.png, g_270d_1f3fb, 270d, 1f3fb

The first two columns represent respectively the SVG and bitmap filenames; either can be
left empty if the font is vector- or bitmap-only.
The third column is the UFO/PostScript glyph name, and it's required.
The fourth and the remaining columns are optional, and contain the Unicode codepoints
as hexadecimal digits; a single codepoint gets added to the cmap, more than one produce
a GSUB ligature, no codepoint leaves the glyph unmapped.

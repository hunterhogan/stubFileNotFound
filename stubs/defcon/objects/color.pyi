class Color(str):

    This object represents a color. This object is immutable.

    The initial argument can be either a color string as defined in the UFO
    specification or a sequence of (red, green, blue, alpha) components.

    By calling str(colorObject) you will get a UFO compatible color string.
    You can also iterate over the object to create a sequence::

        colorTuple = tuple(colorObject)

    A very shallow glyph object for rapid math operations.

    Notes about glyph math:
    -   absolute contour compatibility is required
    -   absolute component, anchor, guideline and image compatibility is NOT required.
        in cases of incompatibility in this data, only compatible data is processed and

        same order as the original.

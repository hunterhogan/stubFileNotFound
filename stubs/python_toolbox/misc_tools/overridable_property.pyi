class OverridableProperty(OwnNameDiscoveringDescriptor):
    '''
    A property which may be overridden.

    This behaves exactly like the built-in `property`, except if you want to
    manually override the value of the property, you can. Example:

        >>> class Thing:
        ...     cat = OverridableProperty(lambda self: 'meow')
        ...
        >>> thing = Thing()
        >>> thing.cat
        'meow'
        >>> thing.cat = 'bark'
        >>> thing.cat
        'bark'

    Passed as a memo to `deepcopy` to specify how objects should be copied.

    This type is meant to be subclassed. `__deepcopy__` methods may check which
    class the memo is to know what kind of deepcopying they should do.

    Typical usage:

        class NetworkStyleCopying(CopyMode): pass

        class Something:
            def __deepcopy__(self, memo):
                if isinstance(memo, NetworkStlyeCopying):
                    # Do network-style copying, whatever that means.
                else:
                    # Do normal copying.

        s = Something()

        new_copy = copy.deepcopy(s, NetworkStyleCopying())
        # Now the new copy will be created using network style copying

Defines the `BinarySearchProfile` class.

See its documentation for more info.
'''
class BinarySearchProfile:
    '''
    A profile of binary search results.

    A binary search profile allows to access all kinds of aspects of the
    results of a binary search, while not having to execute the search more
    than one time.
    '''
    def __init__(self, sequence, value, function=..., *, both=...) -> None:
        '''
        Construct a `BinarySearchProfile`.

        `sequence` is the sequence through which the search is made. `value` is
        the wanted value.

        You may optionally pass a key function as `function`, so instead of the
        objects in `sequence` being compared, their outputs from `function`
        will be compared. If you do pass in a function, it's assumed that it's
        strictly rising.

        In the `both` argument you may put binary search results (with the BOTH
        rounding option.) This will prevent the constructor from performing the
        search itself. It will use the results you provided when giving its
        analysis.

'''Module for resolving strings into Python objects.'''
def resolve(string, root=..., namespace=...): # -> Any | None:
    r'''
    Resolve an address into a Python object. A more powerful version of `eval`.

    The main advantage it has over `eval` is that it automatically imports
    whichever modules are needed to resolve the string.

    For example:

        >>> address_tools.resolve('[list, [1, 2], email]')
        [<type 'list'>, [1, 2], <module 'email' from
        'c:\Python27\lib\email\__init__.pyc'>]

    `root` is an object (usually a module) whose attributes will be looked at
    when searching for the object. `namespace` is a `dict` whose keys will be
    searched as well.
    '''
    ...

def get_object_by_address(address, root=..., namespace=...): # -> Any:
    r'''
    Get an object by its address.

    For example:

        >>> get_object_by_address('email.encoders')
        <module 'email.encoders' from 'c:\Python27\lib\email\encoders.pyc'>

    `root` is an object (usually a module) whose attributes will be looked at
    when searching for the object. `namespace` is a `dict` whose keys will be
    searched as well.

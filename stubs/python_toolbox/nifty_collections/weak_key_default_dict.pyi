class WeakKeyDefaultDict(collections.abc.MutableMapping):
    '''
    A weak key dictionary which can use a default factory.

    This is a combination of `weakref.WeakKeyDictionary` and
    `collections.defaultdict`.

    The keys are referenced weakly, so if there are no more references to the
    key, it gets removed from this dict.

    If a "default factory" is supplied, when a key is attempted that doesn't
    exist the default factory will be called to create its new value.

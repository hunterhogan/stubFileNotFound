class ReasonedBool:
    '''
    A variation on `bool` that also gives a `.reason`.

    This is useful when you want to say "This is False because... (reason.)"

    Unfortunately this class is not a subclass of `bool`, since Python doesn't
    allow subclassing `bool`.

        '''
        Construct the `ReasonedBool`.

        `reason` is the reason *why* it has a value of `True` or `False`. It is
        usually a string, but is allowed to be of any type.

class PermSpace(_VariationRemovingMixin, _VariationAddingMixin, _FixedMapManagingMixin, sequence_tools.CuteSequenceMixin, collections.abc.Sequence, metaclass=PermSpaceType):
    '''
    A space of permutations on a sequence.

    Each item in a `PermSpace` is a `Perm`, i.e. a permutation. This is similar
    to `itertools.permutations`, except it offers far, far more functionality.
    The permutations may be accessed by index number, the permutation space can
    have its range and domain specified, some items can be fixed, and more.

    Here is the simplest possible `PermSpace`:

        >>> perm_space = PermSpace(3)
        <PermSpace: 0..2>
        >>> perm_space[2]
        <Perm: (1, 0, 2)>
        >>> tuple(perm_space)
        (<Perm: (0, 1, 2)>, <Perm: (0, 2, 1)>, <Perm: (1, 0, 2)>,
         <Perm: (1, 2, 0)>, <Perm: (2, 0, 1)>, <Perm: (2, 1, 0)>)

    The members are `Perm` objects, which are sequence-like objects that have
    extra functionality. (See documentation of `Perm` for more info.)

    The permutations are generated on-demand, not in advance. This means you
    can easily create something like `PermSpace(1000)`, which has about
    10**2500 permutations in it (a number that far exceeds the number of
    particles in the universe), in a fraction of a second. You can then fetch
    by index number any permutation of the 10**2500 permutations in a fraction
    of a second as well.

    `PermSpace` allows the creation of various special kinds of permutation
    spaces. For example, you can specify an integer to `n_elements` to set a
    permutation length that's smaller than the sequence length. (a.k.a.
    k-permutaions.) This variation of a `PermSpace` is called "partial" and
    it's one of 8 different variations, that are listed below.

     - Rapplied (Range-applied): having an arbitrary sequence as a range.
       To make one, pass your sequence as the first argument instead of the
       length.

     - Dapplied (Domain-applied): having an arbitrary sequence as a domain.
       To make one, pass a sequence into the `domain` argument.

     - Recurrent: If you provide a sequence (making the space rapplied) and
       that sequence has repeating items, you've made a recurrent `PermSpace`.
       It'll be shorter because all of the copies of same item will be
       considered the same item. (Though they will appear more than once,
       according to their count in the sequence.)

     - Fixed: Having a specified number of indices always pointing at certain
       values, making the space smaller. To make one, pass a dict from each
       key to the value it should be fixed to as the argument `fixed_map`.

     - Sliced: A perm space can be sliced like any Python sequence (except you
       can't change the step.) To make one, use slice notation on an existing
       perm space, e.g. `perm_space[56:100]`.

     - Degreed: A perm space can be limited to perms of a certain degree. (A
       perm's degree is the number of transformations it takes to make it.)
       To make one, pass into the `degrees` argument either a single degree
       (like `5`) or a tuple of different degrees (like `(1, 3, 7)`)

     - Partial: A perm space can be partial, in which case not all elements
       are used in perms. E.g. you can have a perm space of a sequence of
       length 5 but with `n_elements=3`, so every perm will have only 3 items.
       (These are usually called "k-permutations" in math-land.) To make one,
       pass a number as the argument `n_elements`.

     - Combination: If you pass in `is_combination=True` or use the subclass
       `CombSpace`, then you'll have a space of combinations (`Comb`s) instead
       of perms. `Comb`s are like `Perm``s except there's no order to the
       elements. (They are always forced into canonical order.)

     - Typed: If you pass in a perm subclass as `perm_type`, you'll get a typed
       `PermSpace`, meaning that the perms will use the class you provide
       rather than the default `Perm`. This is useful when you want to provide
       extra functionality on top of `Perm` that's specific to your use case.

    Most of these variations can be used in conjuction with each other, but
    some cannot. (See `variation_clashes` in `variations.py` for a list of
    clashes.)

    For each of these variations, there's a function to make a perm space have
    that variation and get rid of it. For example, if you want to make a normal
    perm space be degreed, call `.get_degreed()` on it with the desired
    degrees. If you want to make a degreed perm space non-degreed, access its
    `.undegreed` property. The same is true for all other variations.

    A perm space that has none of these variations is called pure.

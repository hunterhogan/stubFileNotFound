    A selection of variations of a `PermSpace`.

    The `combi` package allows many different variations on `PermSpace`. It may
    be range-applied, recurrent, partial, a combination, and more. Any
    selection of variations from this list is represented by a
    `VariationSelection` object. Some are allowed, while others aren't allowed.

    allowed.)

    variations and then try to create an identical one by using an iterable
    with the same variations, you'll get the original `VariationSelection`
    object you created.

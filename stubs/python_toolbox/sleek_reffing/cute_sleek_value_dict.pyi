    A dictionary which sleekrefs its values and propagates their callback.

    When a value is garbage-collected, it (1) removes itself from this dict and
    (2) calls the dict's own `callback` function.

    This class is like `weakref.WeakValueDictionary`, except (a) it uses
    sleekrefs instead of weakrefs and (b) when a value dies, it calls a
    callback.

    See documentation of `python_toolbox.sleek_reffing.SleekRef` for more
    details about sleekreffing.

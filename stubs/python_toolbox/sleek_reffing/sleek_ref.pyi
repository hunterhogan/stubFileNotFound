    A weakref.

    What this adds over `weakref.ref` is the ability to add custom attributes.

class SleekRef:
    '''
    Sleekref tries to reference an object weakly but if can't does it strongly.

    The problem with weakrefs is that some objects can't be weakreffed, for
    example `list` and `dict` objects. A sleekref tries to create a weakref to
    an object, but if it can't (like for a `list`) it creates a strong one
    instead.

    Thanks to sleekreffing you can avoid memory leaks when manipulating
    weakreffable object, but if you ever want to use non-weakreffable objects
    you are still able to. (Assuming you don't mind the memory leaks or stop
    them some other way.)

    When you call a dead sleekref, it doesn't return `None` like weakref; it
    raises `SleekRefDied`. Therefore, unlike weakref, you can store `None` in a
    sleekref.
    '''
    def __init__(self, thing, callback=...) -> None:
        '''
        Construct the sleekref.

        `thing` is the object we want to sleekref. `callback` is the callable
        to call when the weakref to the object dies. (Only relevant for
        weakreffable objects.)
        '''
        ...
    
    def __call__(self): # -> None:
        '''
        Obtain the sleekreffed object. Raises `SleekRefDied` if reference died.

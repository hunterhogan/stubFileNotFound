    Get the number of identical characters at `string`'s head.

    For example, the result for 'qqqwe' would be `3`, while the result for
    'meow' will be `1`.

    Specify `character` to only consider that character; if a different
    character is found at the head, `0` will be returned.

    Specify `head=False` to search the tail instead of the head.

    Replace instances of `old` in `s` with `new`, starting from the right.

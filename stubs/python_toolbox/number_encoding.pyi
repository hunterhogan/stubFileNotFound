class NumberEncoder:
    '''
    A very simple encoder between lines and strings.

    Example:

        >>> my_encoder = number_encoding.NumberEncoder('isogram')
        >>> my_encoder.encode(10000)
        'rssir'
        >>> my_encoder.encode(10000000)
        'saimmmgrg'
        >>> my_encoder.decode('saimmmgrg')
        10000000

        '''
        Encode the number into a string.

        If `minimum_length > 1`, the string will be padded (with the "zero"
        character) if the number isn't big enough.

"""Generate STAT tables for a Variable Font Family

This module exports the functions "gen_stat_tables" and
"gen_stat_tables_from_config" which can be used to
generate a STAT table for each font in a Variable Font Family.

The STAT AxisValues are constructed using the Google Font's Axis Registry,
https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/axisregistry

The function should be able to make STAT tables for any family with the
following properties:
- All fonts contain the same amount of fvar axes
- All fvar axes have the same ranges

    Generate a stat table for each font in a family from a Python configuration.

    Args:
        stat: either a dictionary or list as described below
        varfonts: a list of variable TTFont instances
        has_italic: a boolean indicating whether the family contains an italic.
            If not provided, the stylename of the font files are inspected to
            determine if any of them contain the word ``Italic``.

    The ``stat`` parameter should normally be a list of axis dictionaries in the
    format used by ``buildStatTable``. This list should *not* contain an entry
    for the ``ital`` axis, as this entry will be generated as appropriate for
    each font if ``has_italic`` is True.

    For example::

        varfonts = [
            "Source-Regular-VF[wdth].ttf",
            "Source-Italic-VF[wdth].ttf"
        ]
        stat = [
                { "tag":"wdth", "name": "Width", "values": [ ... ] }
        ]

    Alternately, to allow different STAT table entries for each font, the ``stat``
    parameter may be a dictionary, whose keys are source IDs (usually source
    filenames) corresponding to the appropriate entry in the ``varfonts``
    dictionary and whose values are the list of axis dictionaries for the font.
    Note that in this case, the axes list is passed to ``buildStatTable`` with
    no further manipulation, meaning that if you want an ``ital`` axis, you
    should specify it manually as part of the dictionary.

    For example::

        stat = {
            "Font[wght].ttf": [
                { "tag":"wdth", "name": "Width", "values": [ ... ] },
                { "tag":"ital", "name": "Italic", "values": [ ... ] }
            ],
            "Font-Italic[wght].ttf": [
                { "tag":"wdth", "name": "Width", "values": [ ... ] },
                { "tag":"ital", "name": "Italic", "values": [ ... ] }
            ]
        }
    """

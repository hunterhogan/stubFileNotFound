        useProductionNames (Optional[bool]):
          By default, when value is None, this will rename glyphs using the
          'public.postscriptNames' in then UFO lib. If the mapping is not
          present, no glyph names are renamed.

          When useProductionNames is None and the UFO lib contains the plist bool key
          "com.github.googlei18n.ufo2ft.keepGlyphNames" set to False, then the 'post'
          table is set to format 3.0 and glyph names are dropped altogether from the
          font, saving a few KBs. Note that this only works for TTF and CFF2 flavored
          fonts. We currently do not support dropping glyph names from CFF 1.0 fonts.
          When the keepGlyphNames lib key is missing or set to True, the glyph names
          will be stored in 'post' table format 2.0 for TTF and CFF2 fonts, or in the
          CFF charset.

          If useProductionNames is False, no glyphs are renamed whether or not the
          'public.postscriptNames' mapping is present.
          If the value is True, but no 'public.postscriptNames' are present,
          then uniXXXX names are generated from the glyphs' unicode.

          The 'com.github.googlei18n.ufo2ft.useProductionNames' key can be set
          in the UFO lib to control this parameter (plist boolean value).

          For legacy reasons, an alias key (with an inverted meaning) is also
          supported: "com.schriftgestaltung.Don't use Production Names";
          when this is present if the UFO lib and is set to True, this is
          equivalent to 'useProductionNames' set to False.

        optimizeCFF (bool | CFFOptimization):
          If True or >= CFFOptimization.SUBROUTINIZE, subroubtinize CFF or CFF2 table
          (if present).

        cffVersion (Optiona[int]):
          The output CFF format, choose between 1 or 2. By default, it's the same as
          as the input OTF's CFF or CFF2 table, if any. Ignored for TTFs.

        subroutinizer (Optional[str]):
          The name of the library to use for compressing CFF charstrings, if optimizeCFF
          is True and CFF or CFF2 table is present. Choose between "cffsubr" or
          "compreffor". By default "cffsubr" is used for both CFF 1 and CFF 2.
          NOTE: compreffor currently doesn't support input fonts with CFF2 table.

    The string must conform to the following notation:
    - an optional python module, followed by '::'
    - a required class name; the class must have a method called 'filter'
      with the same signature as the BaseFilter.
    - an optional list of keyword-only arguments enclosed by parentheses

    Raises ValueError if the string doesn't conform to this specification;
    TypeError if imported name is not a filter class; and ImportError if the
    user-defined module cannot be imported.

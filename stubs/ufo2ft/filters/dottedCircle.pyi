Dotted Circle Filter

This filter checks whether a font contains a glyph for U+25CC (DOTTED CIRCLE),
which is inserted by complex shapers to display mark glyphs which have no
associated base glyph, usually as a result of broken clusters but also for
pedagogical reasons. (For example, to display the marks in a table of glyphs.)

If no dotted circle glyph is present in the font, then one is drawn and added.

Next, the filter creates any additional anchors for the dotted circle glyph to
ensure that all marks can be attached to it. It does this by gathering a list
of anchors, finding the set of base glyphs for each anchor, computing the
average position of the anchor on the base glyph (relative to the glyph's width),
and then creating an anchor at that average position on the dotted circle glyph.

The filter must be run as a "pre" filter. This can be done from the command
line like so::

    fontmake -o ttf -g MyFont.glyphs --filter "DottedCircleFilter(pre=True)"

or in the ``lib.plist`` file of a UFO::

    <key>com.github.googlei18n.ufo2ft.filters</key>
    <array>
      <dict>
        <key>name</key>
        <string>dottedCircle</string>
        <key>pre</key>
        <true/>
      </dict>
    </array>

The filter supports the following options:

margin
    When drawing a dotted circle, the vertical space in units around the dotted
    circle.
sidebearings
    When drawing a dotted circle, additional horizontal space in units around
    the dotted circle.
dots
    Number of dots in the circle.

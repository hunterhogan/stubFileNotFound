    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        An undirected graph.

    weight : object, optional (default: None)
        The data key used to determine the weight of each edge. If None, then

        Whether the normalized Laplacian matrix is used.

    tol : float, optional (default: 1e-8)
        Tolerance of relative residual in eigenvalue computation.

    method : string, optional (default: 'tracemin_pcg')
        Method of eigenvalue computation. It must be one of the tracemin

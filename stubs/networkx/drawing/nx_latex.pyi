    '''Return a string of the LaTeX/TikZ code to draw `G`

    This function produces just the code for the tikzpicture
    without any enclosing environment.

    Parameters
    ==========
    G : NetworkX graph
        The NetworkX graph to be drawn
    pos : string or dict (default "pos")
        The name of the node attribute on `G` that holds the position of each node.
        Positions can be sequences of length 2 with numbers for (x,y) coordinates.
        They can also be strings to denote positions in TikZ style, such as (x, y)
        or (angle:radius).
        If a dict, it should be keyed by node to a position.
        If an empty dict, a circular layout is computed by TikZ.
    tikz_options : string
        The tikzpicture options description defining the options for the picture.
        Often large scale options like `[scale=2]`.
    default_node_options : string
        The draw options for a path of nodes. Individual node options override these.
    node_options : string or dict
        The name of the node attribute on `G` that holds the options for each node.
        Or a dict keyed by node to a string holding the options for that node.
    node_label : string or dict
        The name of the node attribute on `G` that holds the node label (text)
        displayed for each node. If the attribute is "" or not present, the node
        itself is drawn as a string. LaTeX processing such as ``"$A_1$"`` is allowed.
        Or a dict keyed by node to a string holding the label for that node.
    default_edge_options : string
        The options for the scope drawing all edges. The default is "[-]" for
        undirected graphs and "[->]" for directed graphs.
    edge_options : string or dict
        The name of the edge attribute on `G` that holds the options for each edge.
        If the edge is a self-loop and ``"loop" not in edge_options`` the option
        "loop," is added to the options for the self-loop edge. Hence you can
        use "[loop above]" explicitly, but the default is "[loop]".
        Or a dict keyed by edge to a string holding the options for that edge.
    edge_label : string or dict
        The name of the edge attribute on `G` that holds the edge label (text)
        displayed for each edge. If the attribute is "" or not present, no edge
        label is drawn.
        Or a dict keyed by edge to a string holding the label for that edge.
    edge_label_options : string or dict
        The name of the edge attribute on `G` that holds the label options for
        each edge. For example, "[sloped,above,blue]". The default is no options.
        Or a dict keyed by edge to a string holding the label options for that edge.

    Returns
    =======
    latex_code : string
       The text string which draws the desired graph(s) when compiled by LaTeX.

    '''Return latex code to draw the graph(s) in `Gbunch`

    The TikZ drawing utility in LaTeX is used to draw the graph(s).
    If `Gbunch` is a graph, it is drawn in a figure environment.
    If `Gbunch` is an iterable of graphs, each is drawn in a subfigure environment
    within a single figure environment.

    If `as_document` is True, the figure is wrapped inside a document environment
    so that the resulting string is ready to be compiled by LaTeX. Otherwise,

    """Return whether node sets `x` and `y` are d-separated by `z`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : nx.DiGraph
        A NetworkX DAG.

    x : node or set of nodes
        First node or set of nodes in `G`.

    y : node or set of nodes
        Second node or set of nodes in `G`.

    z : node or set of nodes
        Potential separator (set of conditioning nodes in `G`). Can be empty set.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        A boolean that is true if `x` is d-separated from `y` given `z` in `G`.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        The *d-separation* test is commonly used on disjoint sets of
        nodes in acyclic directed graphs.  Accordingly, the algorithm
        raises a :exc:`NetworkXError` if the node sets are not
        disjoint or if the input graph is not a DAG.

    NodeNotFound
        If any of the input nodes are not found in the graph,
        a :exc:`NodeNotFound` exception is raised

    Notes
    -----
    A d-separating set in a DAG is a set of nodes that
    blocks all paths between the two sets. Nodes in `z`
    block a path if they are part of the path and are not a collider,
    or a descendant of a collider. Also colliders that are not in `z`
    block a path. A collider structure along a path
    is ``... -> c <- ...`` where ``c`` is the collider node.

def find_minimal_d_separator(G, x, y, *, included: Incomplete | None = None, restricted: Incomplete | None = None):
    '''Returns a minimal d-separating set between `x` and `y` if possible

    A d-separating set in a DAG is a set of nodes that blocks all
    paths between the two sets of nodes, `x` and `y`. This function
    constructs a d-separating set that is "minimal", meaning no nodes can
    be removed without it losing the d-separating property for `x` and `y`.
    If no d-separating sets exist for `x` and `y`, this returns `None`.

    In a DAG there may be more than one minimal d-separator between two
    sets of nodes. Minimal d-separators are not always unique. This function
    returns one minimal d-separator, or `None` if no d-separator exists.

    Uses the algorithm presented in [1]_. The complexity of the algorithm
    is :math:`O(m)`, where :math:`m` stands for the number of edges in
    the subgraph of G consisting of only the ancestors of `x` and `y`.
    For full details, see [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A networkx DAG.
    x : set | node
        A node or set of nodes in the graph.
    y : set | node
        A node or set of nodes in the graph.
    included : set | node | None
        A node or set of nodes which must be included in the found separating set,
        default is None, which means the empty set.
    restricted : set | node | None
        Restricted node or set of nodes to consider. Only these nodes can be in
        the found separating set, default is None meaning all nodes in ``G``.

    Returns
    -------
    z : set | None
        The minimal d-separating set, if at least one d-separating set exists,
        otherwise None.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        Raises a :exc:`NetworkXError` if the input graph is not a DAG
        or if node sets `x`, `y`, and `included` are not disjoint.

    NodeNotFound
        If any of the input nodes are not found in the graph,
        a :exc:`NodeNotFound` exception is raised.

def is_minimal_d_separator(G, x, y, z, *, included: Incomplete | None = None, restricted: Incomplete | None = None):
    '''Determine if `z` is a minimal d-separator for `x` and `y`.

    A d-separator, `z`, in a DAG is a set of nodes that blocks
    all paths from nodes in set `x` to nodes in set `y`.
    A minimal d-separator is a d-separator `z` such that removing
    any subset of nodes makes it no longer a d-separator.

    Note: This function checks whether `z` is a d-separator AND is
    minimal. One can use the function `is_d_separator` to only check if
    `z` is a d-separator. See examples below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : nx.DiGraph
        A NetworkX DAG.
    x : node | set
        A node or set of nodes in the graph.
    y : node | set
        A node or set of nodes in the graph.
    z : node | set
        The node or set of nodes to check if it is a minimal d-separating set.
        The function :func:`is_d_separator` is called inside this function
        to verify that `z` is in fact a d-separator.
    included : set | node | None
        A node or set of nodes which must be included in the found separating set,
        default is ``None``, which means the empty set.
    restricted : set | node | None
        Restricted node or set of nodes to consider. Only these nodes can be in
        the found separating set, default is ``None`` meaning all nodes in ``G``.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether or not the set `z` is a minimal d-separator subject to
        `restricted` nodes and `included` node constraints.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph([0, 1, 2, 3], create_using=nx.DiGraph)
    >>> G.add_node(4)
    >>> nx.is_minimal_d_separator(G, 0, 2, {1})
    True
    >>> # since {1} is the minimal d-separator, {1, 3, 4} is not minimal
    >>> nx.is_minimal_d_separator(G, 0, 2, {1, 3, 4})
    False
    >>> # alternatively, if we only want to check that {1, 3, 4} is a d-separator
    >>> nx.is_d_separator(G, 0, 2, {1, 3, 4})
    True

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        Raises a :exc:`NetworkXError` if the input graph is not a DAG.

    NodeNotFound
        If any of the input nodes are not found in the graph,
        a :exc:`NodeNotFound` exception is raised.

    Notes
    -----
    This function works on verifying that a set is minimal and
    d-separating between two nodes. Uses criterion (a), (b), (c) on
    page 4 of [1]_. a) closure(`x`) and `y` are disjoint. b) `z` contains
    all nodes from `included` and is contained in the `restricted`
    nodes and in the union of ancestors of `x`, `y`, and `included`.
    c) the nodes in `z` not in `included` are contained in both
    closure(x) and closure(y). The closure of a set is the set of nodes
    connected to the set by a directed path in G.

    The complexity is :math:`O(m)`, where :math:`m` stands for the
    number of edges in the subgraph of G consisting of only the
    ancestors of `x` and `y`.

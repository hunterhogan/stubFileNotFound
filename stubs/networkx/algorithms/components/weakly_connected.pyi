def weakly_connected_components(G) -> Generator[Incomplete]:
    """Generate weakly connected components of G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A directed graph

    Returns
    -------
    comp : generator of sets
        A generator of sets of nodes, one for each weakly connected
        component of G.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If G is undirected.

    Examples
    --------
    Generate a sorted list of weakly connected components, largest first.

    >>> G = nx.path_graph(4, create_using=nx.DiGraph())
    >>> nx.add_path(G, [10, 11, 12])
    >>> [
    ...     len(c)
    ...     for c in sorted(nx.weakly_connected_components(G), key=len, reverse=True)
    ... ]
    [4, 3]

    If you only want the largest component, it's more efficient to
    use max instead of sort:

    >>> largest_cc = max(nx.weakly_connected_components(G), key=len)

def is_weakly_connected(G):
    """Test directed graph for weak connectivity.

    A directed graph is weakly connected if and only if the graph
    is connected when the direction of the edge between nodes is ignored.

    Note that if a graph is strongly connected (i.e. the graph is connected
    even when we account for directionality), it is by definition weakly
    connected as well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
        A directed graph.

    Returns
    -------
    connected : bool
        True if the graph is weakly connected, False otherwise.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If G is undirected.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (2, 1)])

    """Compute edge load.

    WARNING: This concept of edge load has not been analysed
    or discussed outside of NetworkX that we know of.
    It is based loosely on load_centrality in the sense that
    it counts the number of shortest paths which cross each edge.
    This function is for demonstration and testing purposes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A networkx graph

    cutoff : bool, optional (default=False)
        If specified, only consider paths of length <= cutoff.

    Returns
    -------
    A dict keyed by edge 2-tuple to the number of shortest paths
    which use that edge. Where more than one path is shortest
    the count is divided equally among paths.

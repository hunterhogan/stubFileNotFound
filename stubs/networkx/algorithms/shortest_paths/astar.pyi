def astar_path(G, source, target, heuristic: Incomplete | None = None, weight: str = 'weight', *, cutoff: Incomplete | None = None):
    '''Returns a list of nodes in a shortest path between source and target
    using the A* ("A-star") algorithm.

    There may be more than one shortest path.  This returns only one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node for path

    target : node
       Ending node for path

    heuristic : function
       A function to evaluate the estimate of the distance
       from the a node to the target.  The function takes
       two nodes arguments and must return a number.
       If the heuristic is inadmissible (if it might
       overestimate the cost of reaching the goal from a node),
       the result may not be a shortest path.
       The algorithm does not support updating heuristic
       values for the same node due to caching the first
       heuristic calculation per node.

    weight : string or function
       If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
       edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
       joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
       such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
       be one.
       If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
       returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
       positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
       dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
       return a number or None to indicate a hidden edge.

    cutoff : float, optional
       If this is provided, the search will be bounded to this value. I.e. if
       the evaluation function surpasses this value for a node n, the node will not
       be expanded further and will be ignored. More formally, let h\'(n) be the
       heuristic function, and g(n) be the cost of reaching n from the source node. Then,
       if g(n) + h\'(n) > cutoff, the node will not be explored further.
       Note that if the heuristic is inadmissible, it is possible that paths
       are ignored even though they satisfy the cutoff.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoPath
        If no path exists between source and target.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> print(nx.astar_path(G, 0, 4))
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> G = nx.grid_graph(dim=[3, 3])  # nodes are two-tuples (x,y)
    >>> nx.set_edge_attributes(G, {e: e[1][0] * 2 for e in G.edges()}, "cost")
    >>> def dist(a, b):
    ...     (x1, y1) = a
    ...     (x2, y2) = b
    ...     return ((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2) ** 0.5
    >>> print(nx.astar_path(G, (0, 0), (2, 2), heuristic=dist, weight="cost"))
    [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2)]

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The weight function can be used to hide edges by returning None.
    So ``weight = lambda u, v, d: 1 if d[\'color\']=="red" else None``
    will find the shortest red path.

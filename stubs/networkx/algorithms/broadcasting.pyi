def tree_broadcast_center(G):
    """Return the Broadcast Center of the tree `G`.

    The broadcast center of a graph G denotes the set of nodes having
    minimum broadcast time [1]_. This is a linear algorithm for determining
    the broadcast center of a tree with ``N`` nodes, as a by-product it also
    determines the broadcast time from the broadcast center.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : undirected graph
        The graph should be an undirected tree

    Returns
    -------
    BC : (int, set) tuple
        minimum broadcast number of the tree, set of broadcast centers

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If the graph is directed or is a multigraph.

def tree_broadcast_time(G, node: Incomplete | None = None):
    '''Return the Broadcast Time of the tree `G`.

    The minimum broadcast time of a node is defined as the minimum amount
    of time required to complete broadcasting starting from the
    originator. The broadcast time of a graph is the maximum over
    all nodes of the minimum broadcast time from that node [1]_.
    This function returns the minimum broadcast time of `node`.
    If `node` is None the broadcast time for the graph is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : undirected graph
        The graph should be an undirected tree
    node: int, optional
        index of starting node. If `None`, the algorithm returns the broadcast
        time of the tree.

    Returns
    -------
    BT : int
        Broadcast Time of a node in a tree

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If the graph is directed or is a multigraph.

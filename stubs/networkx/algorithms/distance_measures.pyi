def harmonic_diameter(G, sp: Incomplete | None = None):
    '''Returns the harmonic diameter of the graph G.

    The harmonic diameter of a graph is the harmonic mean of the distances
    between all pairs of distinct vertices. Graphs that are not strongly
    connected have infinite diameter and mean distance, making such
    measures not useful. Restricting the diameter or mean distance to
    finite distances yields paradoxical values (e.g., a perfect match
    would have diameter one). The harmonic mean handles gracefully
    infinite distances (e.g., a perfect match has harmonic diameter equal
    to the number of vertices minus one), making it possible to assign a
    meaningful value to all graphs.

    Note that in [1] the harmonic diameter is called "connectivity length":
    however, "harmonic diameter" is a more standard name from the
    theory of metric spaces. The name "harmonic mean distance" is perhaps
    a more descriptive name, but is not used in the literature, so we use the
    name "harmonic diameter" here.

class EdgeComponentAuxGraph:
    """A simple algorithm to find all k-edge-connected components in a graph.

    Constructing the auxiliary graph (which may take some time) allows for the
    k-edge-ccs to be found in linear time for arbitrary k.

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation is based on [1]_. The idea is to construct an auxiliary
    graph from which the k-edge-ccs can be extracted in linear time. The
    auxiliary graph is constructed in $O(|V|\\cdot F)$ operations, where F is the
    complexity of max flow. Querying the components takes an additional $O(|V|)$
    operations. This algorithm can be slow for large graphs, but it handles an
    arbitrary k and works for both directed and undirected inputs.

    The undirected case for k=1 is exactly connected components.
    The undirected case for k=2 is exactly bridge connected components.
    The directed case for k=1 is exactly strongly connected components.

        first using S as the available nodes and s as the source, and then
        using T and t. Recursion stops when the source is the only available

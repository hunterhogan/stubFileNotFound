def k_edge_augmentation(G, k, avail: Incomplete | None = None, weight: Incomplete | None = None, partial: bool = False) -> Generator[Incomplete, Incomplete]:
    '''Finds set of edges to k-edge-connect G.

    Adding edges from the augmentation to G make it impossible to disconnect G
    unless k or more edges are removed. This function uses the most efficient
    function available (depending on the value of k and if the problem is
    weighted or unweighted) to search for a minimum weight subset of available
    edges that k-edge-connects G. In general, finding a k-edge-augmentation is
    NP-hard, so solutions are not guaranteed to be minimal. Furthermore, a
    k-edge-augmentation may not exist.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       An undirected graph.

    k : integer
        Desired edge connectivity

    avail : dict or a set of 2 or 3 tuples
        The available edges that can be used in the augmentation.

        If unspecified, then all edges in the complement of G are available.
        Otherwise, each item is an available edge (with an optional weight).

        In the unweighted case, each item is an edge ``(u, v)``.

        In the weighted case, each item is a 3-tuple ``(u, v, d)`` or a dict
        with items ``(u, v): d``.  The third item, ``d``, can be a dictionary
        or a real number.  If ``d`` is a dictionary ``d[weight]``
        correspondings to the weight.

    weight : string
        key to use to find weights if ``avail`` is a set of 3-tuples where the
        third item in each tuple is a dictionary.

    partial : boolean
        If partial is True and no feasible k-edge-augmentation exists, then all
        a partial k-edge-augmentation is generated. Adding the edges in a
        partial augmentation to G, minimizes the number of k-edge-connected
        components and maximizes the edge connectivity between those
        components. For details, see :func:`partial_k_edge_augmentation`.

    Yields
    ------
    edge : tuple
        Edges that, once added to G, would cause G to become k-edge-connected.
        If partial is False, an error is raised if this is not possible.
        Otherwise, generated edges form a partial augmentation, which
        k-edge-connects any part of G where it is possible, and maximally
        connects the remaining parts.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXUnfeasible
        If partial is False and no k-edge-augmentation exists.

    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If the input graph is directed or a multigraph.

    ValueError:
        If k is less than 1

    Notes
    -----
    When k=1 this returns an optimal solution.

    When k=2 and ``avail`` is None, this returns an optimal solution.
    Otherwise when k=2, this returns a 2-approximation of the optimal solution.

    For k>3, this problem is NP-hard and this uses a randomized algorithm that
        produces a feasible solution, but provides no guarantees on the
        solution weight.

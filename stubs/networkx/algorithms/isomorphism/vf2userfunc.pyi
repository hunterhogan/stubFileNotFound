        Parameters
        ----------
        G1, G2: graph
            The graphs to be tested.

        node_match: callable
            A function that returns True iff node n1 in G1 and n2 in G2
            should be considered equal during the isomorphism test. The
            function will be called like::

               node_match(G1.nodes[n1], G2.nodes[n2])

            That is, the function will receive the node attribute dictionaries
            of the nodes under consideration. If None, then no attributes are
            considered when testing for an isomorphism.

        edge_match: callable
            A function that returns True iff the edge attribute dictionary for
            the pair of nodes (u1, v1) in G1 and (u2, v2) in G2 should be
            considered equal during the isomorphism test. The function will be
            called like::

               edge_match(G1[u1][v1], G2[u2][v2])

            That is, the function will receive the edge attribute dictionaries
            of the edges under consideration. If None, then no attributes are
            considered when testing for an isomorphism.

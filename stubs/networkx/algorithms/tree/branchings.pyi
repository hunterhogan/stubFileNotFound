    """
    Returns the total weight of a branching.

    You must access this function through the networkx.algorithms.tree module.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph
        The directed graph.
    attr : str
        The attribute to use as weights. If None, then each edge will be
        treated equally with a weight of 1.
    default : float
        When `attr` is not None, then if an edge does not have that attribute,
        `default` specifies what value it should take.

    Returns
    -------
    weight: int or float
        The total weight of the branching.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G.add_weighted_edges_from([(0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 4), (2, 3, 3), (3, 4, 2)])

def greedy_branching(G, attr: str = 'weight', default: int = 1, kind: str = 'max', seed: Incomplete | None = None):
    """
    Returns a branching obtained through a greedy algorithm.

    This algorithm is wrong, and cannot give a proper optimal branching.
    However, we include it for pedagogical reasons, as it can be helpful to
    see what its outputs are.

    The output is a branching, and possibly, a spanning arborescence. However,
    it is not guaranteed to be optimal in either case.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph
        The directed graph to scan.
    attr : str
        The attribute to use as weights. If None, then each edge will be
        treated equally with a weight of 1.
    default : float
        When `attr` is not None, then if an edge does not have that attribute,
        `default` specifies what value it should take.
    kind : str
        The type of optimum to search for: 'min' or 'max' greedy branching.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    B : directed graph
        The greedily obtained branching.

def minimal_branching(G, /, *, attr: str = 'weight', default: int = 1, preserve_attrs: bool = False, partition: Incomplete | None = None):
    """
    Returns a minimal branching from `G`.

    A minimal branching is a branching similar to a minimal arborescence but
    without the requirement that the result is actually a spanning arborescence.
    This allows minimal branchinges to be computed over graphs which may not
    have arborescence (such as multiple components).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : (multi)digraph-like
        The graph to be searched.
    attr : str
        The edge attribute used in determining optimality.
    default : float
        The value of the edge attribute used if an edge does not have
        the attribute `attr`.
    preserve_attrs : bool
        If True, preserve the other attributes of the original graph (that are not
        passed to `attr`)
    partition : str
        The key for the edge attribute containing the partition
        data on the graph. Edges can be included, excluded or open using the
        `EdgePartition` enum.

    Returns
    -------
    B : (multi)digraph-like
        A minimal branching.

class ArborescenceIterator:
    """
    Iterate over all spanning arborescences of a graph in either increasing or
    decreasing cost.

    Notes
    -----
    This iterator uses the partition scheme from [1]_ (included edges,
    excluded edges and open edges). It generates minimum spanning
    arborescences using a modified Edmonds' Algorithm which respects the
    partition of edges. For arborescences with the same weight, ties are
    broken arbitrarily.

    """Returns the growing network (GN) digraph with `n` nodes.

    The GN graph is built by adding nodes one at a time with a link to one
    previously added node.  The target node for the link is chosen with
    probability based on degree.  The default attachment kernel is a linear
    function of the degree of a node.

    The graph is always a (directed) tree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of nodes for the generated graph.
    kernel : function
        The attachment kernel.
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default DiGraph)
        Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Examples
    --------
    To create the undirected GN graph, use the :meth:`~DiGraph.to_directed`
    method::

    >>> D = nx.gn_graph(10)  # the GN graph
    >>> G = D.to_undirected()  # the undirected version

    To specify an attachment kernel, use the `kernel` keyword argument::

    >>> D = nx.gn_graph(10, kernel=lambda x: x**1.5)  # A_k = k^1.5

def random_k_out_graph(n, k, alpha, self_loops: bool = True, seed: Incomplete | None = None):
    '''Returns a random `k`-out graph with preferential attachment.

    A random `k`-out graph with preferential attachment is a
    multidigraph generated by the following algorithm.

    1. Begin with an empty digraph, and initially set each node to have
       weight `alpha`.
    2. Choose a node `u` with out-degree less than `k` uniformly at
       random.
    3. Choose a node `v` from with probability proportional to its
       weight.
    4. Add a directed edge from `u` to `v`, and increase the weight
       of `v` by one.
    5. If each node has out-degree `k`, halt, otherwise repeat from
       step 2.

    For more information on this model of random graph, see [1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of nodes in the returned graph.

    k : int
        The out-degree of each node in the returned graph.

    alpha : float
        A positive :class:`float` representing the initial weight of
        each vertex. A higher number means that in step 3 above, nodes
        will be chosen more like a true uniformly random sample, and a
        lower number means that nodes are more likely to be chosen as
        their in-degree increases. If this parameter is not positive, a
        :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

    self_loops : bool
        If True, self-loops are allowed when generating the graph.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`~networkx.classes.MultiDiGraph`
        A `k`-out-regular multidigraph generated according to the above
        algorithm.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `alpha` is not positive.

    Notes
    -----
    The returned multidigraph may not be strongly connected, or even
    weakly connected.

def karate_club_graph():
    '''Returns Zachary\'s Karate Club graph.

    Each node in the returned graph has a node attribute \'club\' that
    indicates the name of the club to which the member represented by that node
    belongs, either \'Mr. Hi\' or \'Officer\'. Each edge has a weight based on the
    number of contexts in which that edge\'s incident node members interacted.

    The dataset is derived from the \'Club After Split From Data\' column of Table 3 in [1]_.
    This was in turn derived from the \'Club After Fission\' column of Table 1 in the
    same paper. Note that the nodes are 0-indexed in NetworkX, but 1-indexed in the
    paper (the \'Individual Number in Matrix C\' column of Table 3 starts at 1). This
    means, for example, that ``G.nodes[9]["club"]`` returns \'Officer\', which
    corresponds to row 10 of Table 3 in the paper.

    Examples
    --------
    To get the name of the club to which a node belongs::

        >>> G = nx.karate_club_graph()
        >>> G.nodes[5]["club"]
        \'Mr. Hi\'
        >>> G.nodes[9]["club"]
        \'Officer\'

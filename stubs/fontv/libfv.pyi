class FontVersion:
    """
    FontVersion is a ttf and otf font version string class that provides support for font version string reads,
    reporting, modification, & writes.  Support is provided for instantiation from ttf and otf fonts, as well
    as from fontTools.ttLib.ttFont objects (https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools).

    The class works on Python "strings".  String types indicated below refer to the Python2 unicode type and Python3
    string type.

    contains_metadata: (boolean) boolean for presence of metadata in version string

    contains_state: (boolean) boolean for presence of state substring metadata in the version string

    develop_string: (string) The string to use for development builds in the absence of git commit SHA1 string

    fontpath: (string) The path to the font file

    is_development: (boolean) boolean for presence of development status substring at version_string_parts[1]

    is_release: (boolean) boolean for presence of release status status substring at version_string_parts[1]

    metadata: (list) A list of metadata substrings in the version string. Either version_string_parts[1:] or empty list

    release_string: (string) The string to use for release builds in the absence of git commit SHA1 string

    For faster convergence in the theta functions, x should
    be chosen closer to 0.

    Guard bits must be added by the caller.

    HYPOTHESIS: if x = 2^(-n), n bits need to be added to
    account for the truncation to a fixed-point number,
    and this is the only significant cancellation error.

    The number of bits lost to roundoff is small and can be

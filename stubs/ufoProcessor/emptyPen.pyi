        This will establish if the glyph is completely empty by drawing the glyph with an EmptyPen.
        Additionally, the unicode of the glyph is checked against a list of known unicode whitespace
        characters. This makes it possible to filter out glyphs that have a valid reason to be empty
        and those that can be ignored.

    For Unix, we follow the XDG spec and support $XDG_DATA_HOME.
    That means, by default "~/.local/share/<AppName>".

        "opinion" (boolean) can be False to disable the appending of
            "Cache" to the base app data dir for Windows. See
            discussion below.

    Typical user cache directories are:
        Mac OS X:   ~/Library/Caches/<AppName>
        Unix:       ~/.cache/<AppName> (XDG default)
        Win XP:     C:\\Documents and Settings\\<username>\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\<AppAuthor>\\<AppName>\\Cache
        Vista:      C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\<AppAuthor>\\<AppName>\\Cache

    On Windows the only suggestion in the MSDN docs is that local settings go in
    the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` directory. This is identical to the non-roaming
    app data dir (the default returned by `user_data_dir` above). Apps typically
    put cache data somewhere *under* the given dir here. Some examples:
        ...\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\<ProfileName>\\Cache
        ...\\Acme\\SuperApp\\Cache\\1.0
    OPINION: This function appends "Cache" to the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` value.
    This can be disabled with the `opinion=False` option.

        "opinion" (boolean) can be False to disable the appending of
            "Logs" to the base app data dir for Windows, and "log" to the
            base cache dir for Unix. See discussion below.

    Typical user cache directories are:
        Mac OS X:   ~/Library/Logs/<AppName>
        Unix:       ~/.cache/<AppName>/log  # or under $XDG_CACHE_HOME if defined
        Win XP:     C:\\Documents and Settings\\<username>\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\<AppAuthor>\\<AppName>\\Logs
        Vista:      C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\<AppAuthor>\\<AppName>\\Logs

    On Windows the only suggestion in the MSDN docs is that local settings
    go in the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` directory. (Note: I\'m interested in
    examples of what some windows apps use for a logs dir.)

    OPINION: This function appends "Logs" to the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA`
    value for Windows and appends "log" to the user cache dir for Unix.
    This can be disabled with the `opinion=False` option.

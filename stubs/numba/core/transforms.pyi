    Arguments
    ---------

    func_ir: Function IR
      the CFG to transform
    target_block_label: int
      the block index/label of the block containing the POP_BLOCK statement


    This implements a CFG transformation to insert a block between two other
    blocks.

    The input situation is:

    ┌───────────────┐
    │   top         │
    │   POP_BLOCK   │
    │   bottom      │
    └───────┬───────┘
            │
    ┌───────▼───────┐
    │               │
    │    RETURN     │
    │               │
    └───────────────┘

    If such a pattern is detected in IR, it means there is a `return` statement
    within a `with` context. The basic idea is to rewrite the CFG as follows:

    ┌───────────────┐
    │   top         │
    │   POP_BLOCK   │
    │               │
    └───────┬───────┘
            │
    ┌───────▼───────┐
    │               │
    │     bottom    │
    │               │
    └───────┬───────┘
            │
    ┌───────▼───────┐
    │               │
    │    RETURN     │
    │               │
    └───────────────┘

    We split the block that contains the `POP_BLOCK` statement into two blocks.
    Everything from the beginning of the block up to and including the
    `POP_BLOCK` statement is considered the 'top' and everything below is
    considered 'bottom'. Finally the jump statements are re-wired to make sure
    the CFG remains valid.

        If it's None, the exit node is not split.

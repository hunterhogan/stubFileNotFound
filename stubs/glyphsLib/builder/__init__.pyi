    Takes in data as Glyphs.app-compatible classes, as documented at

    unless ``preserve_original`` is true.

    If include_instances is True, also returns the parsed instance data.

    If family_name is provided, the master UFOs will be given this name and
    only instances with this name will be returned.

    If generate_GDEF is True, write a `table GDEF {...}` statement in the
    UFO's features.fea, containing GlyphClassDef and LigatureCaretByPos.

    If expand_includes is True, resolve include statements in the GSFont features
    and inline them in the UFO features.fea.

    If minimal is True, it is assumed that the UFOs will only be used in
    font production, and unnecessary steps (e.g. converting background layers)
    will be skipped.

    If preserve_original is True, this works on a copy of the font object
    to avoid modifying the original object.

    a pre-parsed GlyphData object that overrides the default one.

    Currently, the transformations are:

    More transformations may be added in the future.

    Some transformations may have custom parameters that can be set in the
    font. For example, the `propagate_all_anchors` transformation can be
    disabled by setting the custom parameter "Propagate Anchors" to False

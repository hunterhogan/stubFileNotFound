            The `PNG specification`_ defines some common keywords that may be
            used as appropriate:

            - Title: Short (one line) title or caption for image.
            - Author: Name of image's creator.
            - Description: Description of image (possibly long).
            - Copyright: Copyright notice.
            - Creation Time: Time of original image creation
              (usually RFC 1123 format).
            - Software: Software used to create the image.
            - Disclaimer: Legal disclaimer.
            - Warning: Warning of nature of content.
            - Source: Device used to create the image.
            - Comment: Miscellaneous comment;
              conversion from other image format.

            Other keywords may be invented for other purposes.

            If 'Software' is not given, an autogenerated value for Matplotlib
            will be used.  This can be removed by setting it to *None*.

        pil_kwargs : dict, optional
            Keyword arguments passed to `PIL.Image.Image.save`.

            If the 'pnginfo' key is present, it completely overrides

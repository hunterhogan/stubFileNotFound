    Container for colormaps that are known to Matplotlib by name.

    The universal registry instance is `matplotlib.colormaps`. There should be
    no need for users to instantiate `.ColormapRegistry` themselves.

    Read access uses a dict-like interface mapping names to `.Colormap`\\s::

        import matplotlib as mpl
        cmap = mpl.colormaps['viridis']

    Returned `.Colormap`\\s are copies, so that their modification does not
    change the global definition of the colormap.

    Additional colormaps can be added via `.ColormapRegistry.register`::

        mpl.colormaps.register(my_colormap)

    To get a list of all registered colormaps, you can do::

        from matplotlib import colormaps

        Register a new colormap.

        The colormap name can then be used as a string argument to any ``cmap``
        parameter in Matplotlib. It is also available in ``pyplot.get_cmap``.

        The colormap registry stores a copy of the given colormap, so that
        future changes to the original colormap instance do not affect the
        registered colormap. Think of this as the registry taking a snapshot
        of the colormap at registration.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cmap : matplotlib.colors.Colormap
            The colormap to register.

        name : str, optional
            The name for the colormap. If not given, ``cmap.name`` is used.

        force : bool, default: False
            If False, a ValueError is raised if trying to overwrite an already
            registered name. True supports overwriting registered colormaps
            other than the builtin colormaps.

        Remove a colormap from the registry.

        You cannot remove built-in colormaps.

        If the named colormap is not registered, returns with no error, raises
        if you try to de-register a default colormap.

        .. warning::

            Colormap names are currently a shared namespace that may be used
            by multiple packages. Use `unregister` only if you know you
            have registered that name before. In particular, do not
            unregister just in case to clean the name before registering a
            new colormap.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str
            The name of the colormap to be removed.

        ------

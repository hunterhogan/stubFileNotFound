    Define basic tools for triangular mesh analysis and improvement.

    A TriAnalyzer encapsulates a `.Triangulation` object and provides basic
    tools for mesh analysis and mesh improvement.

    Attributes

    Parameters
    ----------
    triangulation : `~matplotlib.tri.Triangulation`
        The encapsulated triangulation to analyze.

        Factors to rescale the triangulation into a unit square.

        Returns
        -------
        (float, float)
            Scaling factors (kx, ky) so that the triangulation
            ``[triangulation.x * kx, triangulation.y * ky]``
            fits exactly inside a unit square.
        """
    def circle_ratios(self, rescale: bool = True):
        """
        Return a measure of the triangulation triangles flatness.

        The ratio of the incircle radius over the circumcircle radius is a
        widely used indicator of a triangle flatness.
        It is always ``<= 0.5`` and ``== 0.5`` only for equilateral
        triangles. Circle ratios below 0.01 denote very flat triangles.

        To avoid unduly low values due to a difference of scale between the 2
        axis, the triangular mesh can first be rescaled to fit inside a unit
        square with `scale_factors` (Only if *rescale* is True, which is
        its default value).

        Parameters
        ----------
        rescale : bool, default: True
            If True, internally rescale (based on `scale_factors`), so that the
            (unmasked) triangles fit exactly inside a unit square mesh.

        Returns
        -------
        masked array
            Ratio of the incircle radius over the circumcircle radius, for
            each 'rescaled' triangle of the encapsulated triangulation.
            Values corresponding to masked triangles are masked out.

        """
    def get_flat_tri_mask(self, min_circle_ratio: float = 0.01, rescale: bool = True):
        """
        Eliminate excessively flat border triangles from the triangulation.

        Returns a mask *new_mask* which allows to clean the encapsulated
        triangulation from its border-located flat triangles
        (according to their :meth:`circle_ratios`).
        This mask is meant to be subsequently applied to the triangulation
        using `.Triangulation.set_mask`.
        *new_mask* is an extension of the initial triangulation mask
        in the sense that an initially masked triangle will remain masked.

        The *new_mask* array is computed recursively; at each step flat
        triangles are removed only if they share a side with the current mesh
        border. Thus, no new holes in the triangulated domain will be created.

        Parameters
        ----------
        min_circle_ratio : float, default: 0.01
            Border triangles with incircle/circumcircle radii ratio r/R will
            be removed if r/R < *min_circle_ratio*.
        rescale : bool, default: True
            If True, first, internally rescale (based on `scale_factors`) so
            that the (unmasked) triangles fit exactly inside a unit square
            mesh.  This rescaling accounts for the difference of scale which
            might exist between the 2 axis.

        Returns
        -------
        array of bool
            Mask to apply to encapsulated triangulation.
            All the initially masked triangles remain masked in the
            *new_mask*.

        Notes
        -----
        The rationale behind this function is that a Delaunay
        triangulation - of an unstructured set of points - sometimes contains
        almost flat triangles at its border, leading to artifacts in plots
        (especially for high-resolution contouring).
        Masked with computed *new_mask*, the encapsulated
        triangulation would contain no more unmasked border triangles
        with a circle ratio below *min_circle_ratio*, thus improving the
        mesh quality for subsequent plots or interpolation.

    def _get_compressed_triangulation(self):

class Triangulation:
    """
    An unstructured triangular grid consisting of npoints points and
    ntri triangles.  The triangles can either be specified by the user
    or automatically generated using a Delaunay triangulation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : (npoints,) array-like
        Coordinates of grid points.
    triangles : (ntri, 3) array-like of int, optional
        For each triangle, the indices of the three points that make
        up the triangle, ordered in an anticlockwise manner.  If not
        specified, the Delaunay triangulation is calculated.
    mask : (ntri,) array-like of bool, optional
        Which triangles are masked out.

    Attributes
    ----------
    triangles : (ntri, 3) array of int
        For each triangle, the indices of the three points that make
        up the triangle, ordered in an anticlockwise manner. If you want to
        take the *mask* into account, use `get_masked_triangles` instead.
    mask : (ntri, 3) array of bool or None
        Masked out triangles.
    is_delaunay : bool
        Whether the Triangulation is a calculated Delaunay
        triangulation (where *triangles* was not specified) or not.

    Notes
    -----
    For a Triangulation to be valid it must not have duplicate points,
    triangles formed from colinear points, or overlapping triangles.

        The returned array has shape (npoints, 3) and allows z-value at (x, y)

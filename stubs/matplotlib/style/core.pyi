def use(style) -> None:
    '''
    Use Matplotlib style settings from a style specification.

    The style name of \'default\' is reserved for reverting back to
    the default style settings.

    .. note::

       This updates the `.rcParams` with the settings from the style.
       `.rcParams` not defined in the style are kept.

    Parameters
    ----------
    style : str, dict, Path or list

        A style specification. Valid options are:

        str
            - One of the style names in `.style.available` (a builtin style or
              a style installed in the user library path).

            - A dotted name of the form "package.style_name"; in that case,
              "package" should be an importable Python package name, e.g. at
              ``/path/to/package/__init__.py``; the loaded style file is
              ``/path/to/package/style_name.mplstyle``.  (Style files in
              subpackages are likewise supported.)

            - The path or URL to a style file, which gets loaded by
              `.rc_params_from_file`.

        dict
            A mapping of key/value pairs for `matplotlib.rcParams`.

        Path
            The path to a style file, which gets loaded by
            `.rc_params_from_file`.

        list
            A list of style specifiers (str, Path or dict), which are applied
            from first to last in the list.

    Notes
    -----
    The following `.rcParams` are not related to style and will be ignored if
    found in a style specification:

    %s
    '''
def context(style, after_reset: bool = False) -> Generator[None]:
    '''
    Context manager for using style settings temporarily.

    Parameters
    ----------
    style : str, dict, Path or list
        A style specification. Valid options are:

        str
            - One of the style names in `.style.available` (a builtin style or
              a style installed in the user library path).

            - A dotted name of the form "package.style_name"; in that case,
              "package" should be an importable Python package name, e.g. at
              ``/path/to/package/__init__.py``; the loaded style file is
              ``/path/to/package/style_name.mplstyle``.  (Style files in
              subpackages are likewise supported.)

            - The path or URL to a style file, which gets loaded by
              `.rc_params_from_file`.
        dict
            A mapping of key/value pairs for `matplotlib.rcParams`.

        Path
            The path to a style file, which gets loaded by
            `.rc_params_from_file`.

        list
            A list of style specifiers (str, Path or dict), which are applied
            from first to last in the list.

    after_reset : bool
        If True, apply style after resetting settings to their defaults;
        otherwise, apply style on top of the current settings.

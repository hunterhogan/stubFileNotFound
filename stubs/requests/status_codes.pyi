The ``codes`` object defines a mapping from common names for HTTP statuses
to their numerical codes, accessible either as attributes or as dictionary
items.

Example::

    >>> import requests
    >>> requests.codes['temporary_redirect']
    307
    >>> requests.codes.teapot
    418
    >>> requests.codes['\o/']
    200

Some codes have multiple names, and both upper- and lower-case versions of
the names are allowed. For example, ``codes.ok``, ``codes.OK``, and
``codes.okay`` all correspond to the HTTP status code 200.

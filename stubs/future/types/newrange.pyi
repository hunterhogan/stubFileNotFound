Nearly identical to xrange.py, by Dan Crosta, from

    https://github.com/dcrosta/xrange.git

This is included here in the ``future`` package rather than pointed to as
a dependency because there is no package for ``xrange`` on PyPI. It is
also tweaked to appear like a regular Python 3 ``range`` object rather
than a Python 2 xrange.

From Dan Crosta's README:

    "A pure-Python implementation of Python 2.7's xrange built-in, with
    some features backported from the Python 3.x range built-in (which
    replaced xrange) in that version."

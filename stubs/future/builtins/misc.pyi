"""
A module that brings in equivalents of various modified Python 3 builtins
into Py2. Has no effect on Py3.

The builtin functions are:

- ``ascii`` (from Py2's future_builtins module)
- ``hex`` (from Py2's future_builtins module)
- ``oct`` (from Py2's future_builtins module)
- ``chr`` (equivalent to ``unichr`` on Py2)
- ``input`` (equivalent to ``raw_input`` on Py2)
- ``next`` (calls ``__next__`` if it exists, else ``next`` method)
- ``open`` (equivalent to io.open on Py2)
- ``super`` (backport of Py3's magic zero-argument super() function
- ``round`` (new "Banker's Rounding" behaviour from Py3)
- ``max`` (new default option from Py3.4)
- ``min`` (new default option from Py3.4)

``isinstance`` is also currently exported for backwards compatibility
with v0.8.2, although this has been deprecated since v0.9.


input()
-------
Like the new ``input()`` function from Python 3 (without eval()), except
that it returns bytes. Equivalent to Python 2's ``raw_input()``.

Warning: By default, importing this module *removes* the old Python 2
input() function entirely from ``__builtin__`` for safety. This is
because forgetting to import the new ``input`` from ``future`` might
otherwise lead to a security vulnerability (shell injection) on Python 2.

To restore it, you can retrieve it yourself from
``__builtin__._old_input``.

Fortunately, ``input()`` seems to be seldom used in the wild in Python
2...

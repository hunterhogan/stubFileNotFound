r"""HTTP cookie handling for web clients.

This is a backport of the Py3.3 ``http.cookiejar`` module for
python-future.

This module has (now fairly distant) origins in Gisle Aas' Perl module
HTTP::Cookies, from the libwww-perl library.

Docstrings, comments and debug strings in this code refer to the
attributes of the HTTP cookie system as cookie-attributes, to distinguish
them clearly from Python attributes.

Class diagram (note that BSDDBCookieJar and the MSIE* classes are not
distributed with the Python standard library, but are available from
http://wwwsearch.sf.net/):

    If the header_values passed as argument contains multiple values, then they
    are treated as if they were a single value separated by comma ",".

    This means that this function is useful for parsing header fields that
    follow this syntax (BNF as from the HTTP/1.1 specification, but we relax
    the requirement for tokens).

    simple token (not part of a parameter) is None.  Syntactically incorrect
    headers will not necessarily be parsed as you would want.

    WARNING: you may want to backup your browser's cookies file if you use
    this class to save cookies.  I *think* it works, but there have been
    bugs in the past!

    This class differs from CookieJar only in the format it uses to save and
    load cookies to and from a file.  This class uses the Mozilla/Netscape
    `cookies.txt' format.  lynx uses this file format, too.

    Don't expect cookies saved while the browser is running to be noticed by
    the browser (in fact, Mozilla on unix will overwrite your saved cookies if
    you change them on disk while it's running; on Windows, you probably can't
    save at all while the browser is running).

    Note that the Mozilla/Netscape format will downgrade RFC2965 cookies to
    Netscape cookies on saving.

    In particular, the cookie version and port number information is lost,
    together with information about whether or not Path, Port and Discard were
    specified by the Set-Cookie2 (or Set-Cookie) header, and whether or not the
    domain as set in the HTTP header started with a dot (yes, I'm aware some
    domains in Netscape files start with a dot and some don't -- trust me, you
    really don't want to know any more about this).

    Note that though Mozilla and Netscape use the same format, they use
    slightly different headers.  The class saves cookies using the Netscape
    header by default (Mozilla can cope with that).

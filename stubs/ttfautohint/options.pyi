    for ttfautohint.ttfautohint function.

    `args` can be either None, a list of strings, or a single string,
    that is split into individual options with `shlex.split`.

    When `args` is None, the console's default sys.argv are used, and any
    SystemExit exceptions raised by argparse are propagated.

    If args is a string list or a string, it is assumed that the function
    was not called from a console script's `main` entry point, but from
    other client code, and thus the SystemExit exceptions are muted and
    a `None` value is returned.

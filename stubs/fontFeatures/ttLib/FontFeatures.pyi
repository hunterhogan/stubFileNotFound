"""Convert a fontFeatures object to GPOS/GSUB/GDEF tables

This module contains routines for building binary layout tables from a
fontFeatures object. These are implemented as mixins loaded into the
fontFeatures object. e.g. instead of::

    fontFeatures.ttLib.FontFeatures.buildBinaryFeatures(ff, font)

call::

    ff.buildBinaryFeatures(font)

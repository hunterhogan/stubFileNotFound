    """Provide audio data from a sound file as NumPy array.

    By default, the whole file is read from the beginning, but the
    position to start reading can be specified with *start* and the
    number of frames to read can be specified with *frames*.
    Alternatively, a range can be specified with *start* and *stop*.

    If there is less data left in the file than requested, the rest of
    the frames are filled with *fill_value*.
    If no *fill_value* is specified, a smaller array is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : str or int or file-like object
        The file to read from.  See `SoundFile` for details.
    frames : int, optional
        The number of frames to read. If *frames* is negative, the whole
        rest of the file is read.  Not allowed if *stop* is given.
    start : int, optional
        Where to start reading.  A negative value counts from the end.
    stop : int, optional
        The index after the last frame to be read.  A negative value
        counts from the end.  Not allowed if *frames* is given.
    dtype : {'float64', 'float32', 'int32', 'int16'}, optional
        Data type of the returned array, by default ``'float64'``.
        Floating point audio data is typically in the range from
        ``-1.0`` to ``1.0``.  Integer data is in the range from
        ``-2**15`` to ``2**15-1`` for ``'int16'`` and from ``-2**31`` to
        ``2**31-1`` for ``'int32'``.

        .. note:: Reading int values from a float file will *not*
            scale the data to [-1.0, 1.0). If the file contains
            ``np.array([42.6], dtype='float32')``, you will read
            ``np.array([43], dtype='int32')`` for ``dtype='int32'``.

    Returns
    -------
    audiodata : `numpy.ndarray` or type(out)
        A two-dimensional (frames x channels) NumPy array is returned.
        If the sound file has only one channel, a one-dimensional array
        is returned.  Use ``always_2d=True`` to return a two-dimensional
        array anyway.

        If *out* was specified, it is returned.  If *out* has more
        frames than available in the file (or if *frames* is smaller
        than the length of *out*) and no *fill_value* is given, then
        only a part of *out* is overwritten and a view containing all
        valid frames is returned.
    samplerate : int
        The sample rate of the audio file.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    always_2d : bool, optional
        By default, reading a mono sound file will return a
        one-dimensional array.  With ``always_2d=True``, audio data is
        always returned as a two-dimensional array, even if the audio
        file has only one channel.
    fill_value : float, optional
        If more frames are requested than available in the file, the
        rest of the output is be filled with *fill_value*.  If
        *fill_value* is not specified, a smaller array is returned.
    out : `numpy.ndarray` or subclass, optional
        If *out* is specified, the data is written into the given array
        instead of creating a new array.  In this case, the arguments
        *dtype* and *always_2d* are silently ignored!  If *frames* is
        not given, it is obtained from the length of *out*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : str or int or file-like object

        '''Open a sound file.

        If a file is opened with `mode` ``\'r\'`` (the default) or
        ``\'r+\'``, no sample rate, channels or file format need to be
        given because the information is obtained from the file. An
        exception is the ``\'RAW\'`` data format, which always requires
        these data points.

        File formats consist of three case-insensitive strings:

        * a *major format* which is by default obtained from the
          extension of the file name (if known) and which can be
          forced with the format argument (e.g. ``format=\'WAVEX\'``).
        * a *subtype*, e.g. ``\'PCM_24\'``. Most major formats have a
          default subtype which is used if no subtype is specified.
        * an *endian-ness*, which doesn\'t have to be specified at all in
          most cases.

        A `SoundFile` object is a *context manager*, which means
        if used in a "with" statement, `close()` is automatically
        called when reaching the end of the code block inside the "with"
        statement.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file : str or int or file-like object
            The file to open.  This can be a file name, a file
            descriptor or a Python file object (or a similar object with
            the methods ``read()``/``readinto()``, ``write()``,
            ``seek()`` and ``tell()``).
        mode : {\'r\', \'r+\', \'w\', \'w+\', \'x\', \'x+\'}, optional
            Open mode.  Has to begin with one of these three characters:
            ``\'r\'`` for reading, ``\'w\'`` for writing (truncates *file*)
            or ``\'x\'`` for writing (raises an error if *file* already
            exists).  Additionally, it may contain ``\'+\'`` to open
            *file* for both reading and writing.
            The character ``\'b\'`` for *binary mode* is implied because
            all sound files have to be opened in this mode.
            If *file* is a file descriptor or a file-like object,
            ``\'w\'`` doesn\'t truncate and ``\'x\'`` doesn\'t raise an error.
        samplerate : int
            The sample rate of the file.  If `mode` contains ``\'r\'``,
            this is obtained from the file (except for ``\'RAW\'`` files).
        channels : int
            The number of channels of the file.
            If `mode` contains ``\'r\'``, this is obtained from the file
            (except for ``\'RAW\'`` files).
        subtype : str, sometimes optional
            The subtype of the sound file.  If `mode` contains ``\'r\'``,
            this is obtained from the file (except for ``\'RAW\'``
            files), if not, the default value depends on the selected
            `format` (see `default_subtype()`).
            See `available_subtypes()` for all possible subtypes for
            a given `format`.
        endian : {\'FILE\', \'LITTLE\', \'BIG\', \'CPU\'}, sometimes optional
            The endian-ness of the sound file.  If `mode` contains
            ``\'r\'``, this is obtained from the file (except for
            ``\'RAW\'`` files), if not, the default value is ``\'FILE\'``,
            which is correct in most cases.
        format : str, sometimes optional
            The major format of the sound file.  If `mode` contains
            ``\'r\'``, this is obtained from the file (except for
            ``\'RAW\'`` files), if not, the default value is determined
            from the file extension.  See `available_formats()` for
            all possible values.
        closefd : bool, optional
            Whether to close the file descriptor on `close()`. Only
            applicable if the *file* argument is a file descriptor.
        compression_level : float, optional
            The compression level on \'write()\'. The compression level
            should be between 0.0 (minimum compression level) and 1.0
            (highest compression level).
            See `libsndfile document <https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/blob/c81375f070f3c6764969a738eacded64f53a076e/docs/command.md>`__.
        bitrate_mode : {\'CONSTANT\', \'AVERAGE\', \'VARIABLE\'}, optional
            The bitrate mode on \'write()\'.
            See `libsndfile document <https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/blob/c81375f070f3c6764969a738eacded64f53a076e/docs/command.md>`__.

                scale the data to [-1.0, 1.0). If the file contains
                ``np.array([42.6], dtype='float32')``, you will read
                ``np.array([43], dtype='int32')`` for
                ``dtype='int32'``.

        Returns
        -------
        audiodata : `numpy.ndarray` or type(out)
            A two-dimensional NumPy (frames x channels) array is
            returned. If the sound file has only one channel, a
            one-dimensional array is returned. Use ``always_2d=True``
            to return a two-dimensional array anyway.

            If *out* was specified, it is returned. If *out* has more
            frames than available in the file (or if *frames* is
            smaller than the length of *out*) and no *fill_value* is
            given, then only a part of *out* is overwritten and a view
            containing all valid frames is returned.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        always_2d : bool, optional
            By default, reading a mono sound file will return a
            one-dimensional array. With ``always_2d=True``, audio data
            is always returned as a two-dimensional array, even if the
            audio file has only one channel.
        fill_value : float, optional
            If more frames are requested than available in the file,
            the rest of the output is be filled with *fill_value*. If
            *fill_value* is not specified, a smaller array is
            returned.
        out : `numpy.ndarray` or subclass, optional
            If *out* is specified, the data is written into the given
            array instead of creating a new array. In this case, the
            arguments *dtype* and *always_2d* are silently ignored! If
            *frames* is not given, it is obtained from the length of
            *out*.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> from soundfile import SoundFile
        >>> myfile = SoundFile('stereo_file.wav')

        Reading 3 frames from a stereo file:

        >>> myfile.read(3)

        data : array_like

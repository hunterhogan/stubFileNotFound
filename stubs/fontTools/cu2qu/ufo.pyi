    All curves will be converted to quadratic at once, ensuring interpolation
    compatibility. If this is not required, calling fonts_to_quadratic with one
    font at a time may yield slightly more optimized results.

    Empty glyphs (without contours) are ignored and passed through unchanged.

    Return the set of modified glyph names if any, else return an empty set.

    By default, cu2qu stores the curve type in the fonts\' lib, under a private
    key "com.github.googlei18n.cu2qu.curve_type", and will not try to convert
    them again if the curve type is already set to "quadratic".
    Setting \'remember_curve_type\' to False disables this optimization.

    Raises IncompatibleFontsError if same-named glyphs from different fonts
    have non-interpolatable outlines.

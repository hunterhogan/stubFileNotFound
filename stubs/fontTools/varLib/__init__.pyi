"""
Module for dealing with 'gvar'-style font variations, also known as run-time
interpolation.

The ideas here are very similar to MutatorMath.  There is even code to read
MutatorMath .designspace files in the varLib.designspace module.

For now, if you run this file on a designspace file, it tries to find
ttf-interpolatable files for the masters and build a variable-font from
them.  Such ttf-interpolatable and designspace files can be generated from
a Glyphs source, eg., using noto-source as an example:

    .. code-block:: sh

        $ fontmake -o ttf-interpolatable -g NotoSansArabic-MM.glyphs

Then you can make a variable-font this way:

    .. code-block:: sh

        $ fonttools varLib master_ufo/NotoSansArabic.designspace

API *will* change in near future.

    Depending on whether the `axisLimits` dictionary references all or some of the

    font) or a variable font with possibly less variation data.

    Args:
        varfont: a TTFont instance, which must contain at least an 'fvar' table.
        axisLimits: a dict keyed by axis tags (str) containing the coordinates (float)
            along one or more axes where the desired instance will be located.

            that axis is used.
            The limit values can also be (min, max) tuples for restricting an
            axis's variation range. The default axis value must be included in
            the new range.
        inplace (bool): whether to modify input TTFont object in-place instead of
            returning a distinct object.
        optimize (bool): if False, do not perform IUP-delta optimization on the
            remaining 'gvar' table's deltas. Possibly faster, and might work around
            rendering issues in some buggy environments, at the cost of a slightly
            larger file size.
        overlap (OverlapMode): variable fonts usually contain overlapping contours, and
            some font rendering engines on Apple platforms require that the
            `OVERLAP_SIMPLE` and `OVERLAP_COMPOUND` flags in the 'glyf' table be set to
            force rendering using a non-zero fill rule. Thus we always set these flags
            on all glyphs to maximise cross-compatibility of the generated instance.
            You can disable this by passing OverlapMode.KEEP_AND_DONT_SET_FLAGS.
            If you want to remove the overlaps altogether and merge overlapping
            contours and components, you can pass OverlapMode.REMOVE (or
            REMOVE_AND_IGNORE_ERRORS to not hard-fail on tricky glyphs). Note that this
            requires the skia-pathops package (available to pip install).
            The overlap parameter only has effect when generating full static instances.
        updateFontNames (bool): if True, update the instantiated font's name table using
            the Axis Value Tables from the STAT table. The name table and the style bits
            in the head and OS/2 table will be updated so they conform to the R/I/B/BI
            model. If the STAT table is missing or an Axis Value table is missing for
            a given axis coordinate, a ValueError will be raised.
        downgradeCFF2 (bool): if True, downgrade the CFF2 table to CFF table when possible
            ie. full instancing of all axes. This is useful for compatibility with older
            software that does not support CFF2. Defaults to False. Note that this
            operation also removes overlaps within glyph shapes, as CFF does not support
            overlaps but CFF2 does.
        static (bool): if True, generate a full instance (static font) instead of a partial
            instance (variable font).

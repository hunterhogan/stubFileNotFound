class Merger:
    """Font merger.

    This class merges multiple files into a single OpenType font, taking into
    account complexities such as OpenType layout (``GSUB``/``GPOS``) tables and
    cross-font metrics (for example ``hhea.ascent`` is set to the maximum value
    across all the fonts).

    If multiple glyphs map to the same Unicode value, and the glyphs are considered
    sufficiently different (that is, they differ in any of paths, widths, or
    height), then subsequent glyphs are renamed and a lookup in the ``locl``
    feature will be created to disambiguate them. For example, if the arguments
    are an Arabic font and a Latin font and both contain a set of parentheses,
    the Latin glyphs will be renamed to ``parenleft.1`` and ``parenright.1``,
    and a lookup will be inserted into the to ``locl`` feature (creating it if
    necessary) under the ``latn`` script to substitute ``parenleft`` with
    ``parenleft.1`` etc.

    Restrictions:

    - All fonts must have the same units per em.
    - If duplicate glyph disambiguation takes place as described above then the
      fonts must have a ``GSUB`` table.

    Attributes:
            options: Currently unused.

    Takes a iterable of iterables (list of sets from here on; but any
    iterable works.), and returns the smallest list of sets such that
    each set, is either a subset, or is disjoint from, each of the input
    sets.

    In other words, this function classifies all the things present in
    any of the input sets, into similar classes, based on which sets
    things are a member of.

    If sort=True, return class sets are sorted by decreasing size and
    their natural sort order within each class size.  Otherwise, class
    sets are returned in the order that they were identified, which is
    generally not significant.

        Construct a new pen.

        Args:
            glyphSet (Dict[str, Any]): A glyphset object, used to resolve components.
            handleOverflowingTransforms (bool): See below.

        If ``handleOverflowingTransforms`` is True, the components' transform values
        are checked that they don't overflow the limits of a F2Dot14 number:
        -2.0 <= v < +2.0. If any transform value exceeds these, the composite
        glyph is decomposed.

        An exception to this rule is done for values that are very close to +2.0
        (both for consistency with the -2.0 case, and for the relative frequency
        these occur in real fonts). When almost +2.0 values occur (and all other
        values are within the range -2.0 <= x <= +2.0), they are clamped to the
        maximum positive value that can still be encoded as an F2Dot14: i.e.
        1.99993896484375.

        If False, no check is done and all components are translated unmodified
        into the glyf table, followed by an inevitable ``struct.error`` once an
        attempt is made to compile them.

        If both contours and components are present in a glyph, the components
        are decomposed.
